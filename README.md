# Much-Worse jekyll theme

This is a modified version of [Steve Miller's NGVM theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/svm-ngvb/). Since this work is a derivative of Prof. Miller's, therefore it is only fair that I honour his self-deprecating spirit and name this **much-worse**. I prefer large seriff fonts and minimal coloring and styling. Apart form the typography, color scheme and layout,
this theme has two useful changes:

- It allows you to maintain your website as a subdirectory on your university of company domain (e.g. http://university.edu/department/people/your-website). Most Jekyll blogs are
designed to be hosted at custom domain names.

- Most jekyll themes are blog-centric, or single page websites. This theme lets you create multi-page website with a blog if you want.

Both the above are not seminal achievements in science, but they are useful. This theme also supports site analytics including [Statcounter](http://statcounter.com) and major comment providers for blogs.

See it in action [here](http://people.csail.mit.edu/gchauras).

Feel free to send me pull requests with better responsive performance or cleaner HTML/CSS.
