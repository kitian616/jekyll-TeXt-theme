I"Ó<p>The exponential family distributions are very important in graphical models and Bayesian learning. They have nice properties, like conjugacy and finite sufficient statistics, which enable the convenience and efficiency of the inference and learning process. Yet, I only almost know the details of exponential family distribution. The minor gap between â€œalmost knowâ€ and â€œknowâ€ prevents me from understanding it completely. Here I try to close the gap.</p>
