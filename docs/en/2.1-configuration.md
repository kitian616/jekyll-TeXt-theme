Jekyll allows you to concoct your sites in any way you can dream up, and it’s thanks to the powerful and flexible configuration options that this is possible. These options can either be specified in a `_config.yml` file placed in your site’s root directory, or can be specified as flags for the jekyll executable in the terminal.

For technical reasons, `_config.yml` is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use `jekyll serve`. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

### URL

Jekyll 3.3 overrides this value with url: http://localhost:4000 when running `jekyll serve` in a development environment[^jekyll_site_variables]. You can specifying Jekyll environment[^jekyll_specifying_environment] to production environment by `JEKYLL_ENV=production` to avoid this behavior.
