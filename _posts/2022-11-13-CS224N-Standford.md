First of all, This writing consists of cource Standford CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning on Winter 2021. And it also includes 2018 CS224n because of assignment 5 related to Convolution model based on pytorch and Colab(.ipynb)

### Lecture
1. Week 1 What is the basic concept and Framework in Natural Language Process?
2. Week 2 How to Calculate in Neural Network and What is the Dependency Parsing?
3. Week 3 How to struct the Dependency Parsing and the Problem solved by RNN, Bi-RNN, GRU, LTSM?
4. Week 4 Machine Translation, Sequence-to-Sequence, And Attention
5. Week 5 Self-Attention and Transformers
<br>

After week 5, lectures explain, <br>
- (Week 5-6) QA<br>
- (Week 6) Generation<br>
- (Week 7) Coreference Resolution<br>
- (Week 7) T5<br>
- (Week 8) Language Model<br>
- (Week 8) Ethics<br>
- (Week 9) Analysis and Explanation<br>
- (Week 9) Future<br>
<br>

But I want to learn more closer to contents related to Speech, so I completed this lecture and continue to **CS224S**
