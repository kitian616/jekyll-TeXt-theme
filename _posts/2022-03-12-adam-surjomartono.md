I was acquainted with Brother Nat and his family over the 13 years they were in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. I spent a lot of time with him in their home, in our home, in meetings, in the homes of the saints, on the streets handing out literature, on the road, while traveling and while serving together. Our families visited each other often and our children practically grew up together in the church life. I saw his way of living… how he conducted himself in the house of God, in his family, and in front of other people.

Brother Nat was constituted with the ministry of the age, which he faithfully followed. Even in his spare time, I often saw him reading the Word, the life-studies, and other ministry material. I would also see him listening to messages. Thus, he had a rich deposit of truth within him, which was evident not only by his sharing in the meetings, but also in his personal contact with people.
Brother Nat loved to sing to the Lord with the saints and often joined them on the guitar. He always encouraged others to exercise and release their spirits and voices in calling on the Lord's name, in prayer, and in singing. He also encouraged brothers and sisters to eat the Word, to receive the ministry, and to speak unashamedly in meetings. He was always ready and prepared to share the gospel with seekers and unbelievers. You could see some leaflets peeking out from his shirt pocket.

In his interactions with people, Brother Nat was gentle and kind, and his smile warmed people up. He loved to talk with people and listen to them. Although he labored and served diligently, he never drew attention to himself. The saints greatly appreciated Brother Nat learning Czech so that he could communicate without an interpreter. He often asked me about grammar or pronunciation and then would try to use what he had learned.
Thanks to Sister Wanchi's support, their household was always open to saints and non-believing friends. The children's Bible camps originated with the Kong family and they continue to this day. They are looked forward to every year by families and saints from both our countries.

I will forever be grateful to the Lord for Brother Nat, with assurance that his life and service will still bear much fruit for the building up of the Body of Christ.
