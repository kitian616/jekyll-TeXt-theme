### Intro

- Create a model such that given the center word "jumped", the model will be able to predict or generate the surrounding words "The", "cat", "over", "the", "puddle".
    
    → Predicts the distribution (probability) of context words from a center word.
    
- we essentially swap our x and y
    
    i.e. x in the CBOW are now y and vice-versa.
    
- The input one-hot vector (center word) we will represent with an x (since there is only one).
- The output vectors as $y^{(j)}$.
- We define V and U the same as in [CBOW](/2021/09/27/continuous-back-of-words).

### Steps

1. Generate one hot input vector
    
    $x \in \mathbb{R}^{\lvert V\lvert}$ of the center word
    
2. We get our embedded word vector for the center word $v_c = \nu x \in \mathbb{R}^n$
3. Generate a score vector z = $uv_c$
4. Turn the score vector into probabilities, $\hat{y} = softmax(z)$
    
    - $\hat{y} _{c-m}, \ \dots, \ \hat{y} _{c-1},\ \hat{y} _{c+1},\ \dots,\ \hat{y} _{c+m}$ are the probabilities of observing each context word.
5. We desire our probability vector generated to match the true prob- abilities which is $y^{(c−m)},\ \dots ,\ y^{(c−1)},\ y^{(c+1)},\ \dots ,\ y^{(c+m)}$, the one hot vectors of the actual output.

- Invoke a Naive Bayes assumption to break out the probabilities. If you have not seen this before, then simply put, it is a strong (naive) conditional independence assumption. In other words, given the center word, all output words are completely independent.

- With this objective function, we can compute the gradients with respect to the unknown parameters and at each iteration update them via Stochastic Gradient Descent.

*H*($\hat{y}, y_{c−m+j}$) is the cross-entropy between the probability vector $\hat{y}$ and the one-hot vector $y_{c−m+j}$
