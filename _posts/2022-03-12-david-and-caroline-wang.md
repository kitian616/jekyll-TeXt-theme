When my wife and I received the tragic news regarding our dearest brother Nat, we were shocked and grieved beyond which any words can express. However, one thing we do know, is that our dearest brother Nat was deeply loved by the Lord. Therefore, we have no words, no question before Him, only heartaches and tears. Our grief is only comforted by the assurance that there is a crown of righteousness and a crown of life prepared for Nat, and we shall meet again in the kingdom age. O Lord, come quickly, our love is waiting for You.

Our dearest brother Nat is one in whom we found no guile, pure in heart, and poor in spirit, always ready to serve with a genuine smile. He is loved by God and man.

We remember almost 20 years of glorious meeting and serving together in the Kong's house, in our home, and in the Sacramento meeting hall. Those joyful days when we were working together in remodeling the meeting hall, laying the sprinkler pipes and lawn around the meeting hall, and having many delicious meals and sweet fellowship with the Kong family. Those memories will be our eternal joy and encouragement for us to love the Lord and continue to run the unfinished course before the Lord's return.

Nat and the entire Kong family are so, so dear to our hearts. They are such an encouragement to us. We are honored to have known them, and we are eternally grateful for the patterns they set before us. Thank you Lord.

We want to use the words from brother Nee's hymn "Let me love" to describe Nat.

"Let me love, and not be regarded;
Let me serve, and not be rewarded;
Let me labor and not be accounted;
Let me suffer and not be noticed;
'Tis the pouring, not the drinking;
'Tis the breaking, not the keeping—
A life suffering to seek others' blessing,
A life loving and true comfort giving."

This is the testimony of our brother Nat Kong. In nothing he was put to shame. Christ is magnified in his body, whether through life or through death. Amen.
