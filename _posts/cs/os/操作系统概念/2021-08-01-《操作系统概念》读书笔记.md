# Operating System Concepts

## Part 1 Overview

操作系统在计算机硬件和计算机用户之间扮演中间人的角色。操作系统为用户执行应用程序提供了更简单、高效的方式。

操作系统庞大而复杂，所以它的每一部分必须经过精心设计，包括输入输出和功能。

## Chapter1 Introduction

An operating system is a software that manages a computer's hardware. 

It also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware.

### Chapter Objectives

* Describe the general organization of a computer system and the role of **interrupts**.

* Describe the general components in a modern **multiprocessor** computer system.

* Illustrate the transition from **user mode** to **kernel mode**.
* Discuss how operating system are used in various computing environments.
* Provide examples of free and open-source operating systems.

## 1.1 What Operating Systems Do

A computer systems can be divided roughly into four components: the ***hardware***, the ***operating system***, the ***application programs*** and a ***user*** (Figure 1.1).

* The **hardware**: the central processing unit (CPU), the memory, and the input/output (I/O) devices - provides the basic computing resources for the system.
* The **application program**: defines the ways in which these resources are used to solve user's computing problems.
* The **operating system**: controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the various users.

The other view of computer system is: **hardware**, **software** and **data**. An operating system is similar to a government. Like a government, it performs no useful function by itself. It simply provides ***environment*** within which other programs can do useful work.

### 1.1.1 User View

* Some are designed for ease of use, such as a laptop or PC consisting of a monitor, keyboard and mouse. 

* Some the user interacts with the system by pressing and swiping fingers across the screen rather than using a physical keyboard and mouse. such as smartphones and tablets. 

* Some computers have little or no user view. For example, **embedded computers** which's operating systems and applications are designed primarily to run without user intervention.

 ### 1.1.2 System View

* From the computer's point of view, the operating system is the program most intimately involved with the hardware. In this context, we can view an operating system as a **resource allocator**. A computer system has many resources that may be required to solve a problem: CPU time, memory space, storage space, I/O devices and so on.
* An operating system is a **control program**. A control program manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. It especially concerned with the operation and control of I/O devices.

### 1.1.3 Defining Operating Systems

In general, we have no completely adequate definition of an operating system. 

* Why there is an operating system?

  > Operating systems exist because they offer a reasonable way to solve the problem of creating a usable computing system. The fundamental goal of computer system is to execute programs and to make solving user programs easier. Computer hardware is to constructed toward this goal. Since bare hardware alone is not particularly to use, application programs are developed. These programs require certain common operations, such as those controlling the I/O devices. The common functions of controlling and allocating resources are then brought together into one piece of software: the **operating system**.

* A more common definition of operating system

  > The one that we usually follow, is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer — usually called the **kernel**. 

  > Along with the kernel, there are two other types of programs: **system programs**, which are associated with the operating system but are not necessarily part of the kernel, and **application programs**, which include all programs not associated with the operation of the system.

  > Mobile operating system often include not only a core kernel but also **middleware** — a set of software frameworks that provide additional services to application developers. 

* In summary, for our purpose, the operating system includes the always-running kernel, middleware frameworks that ease application development and provide features, and system programs that aid in managing the system while it is running.

## 1.2 Computer-System Organization

A modern general-purpose computer system consists of one or more CPUs and a number of device controllers connected through a common **bus** that provides access between components and shared memory (Figure 1.2).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wholon/image/main/OperatingSystemConcepts/屏幕截图 2020-12-07 140802.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

Typically, operating systems have a device driver for each device controller. This device driver understands the device controller and provides the rest of the operating system with a uniform interface to the device. The CPU and the device controllers can execute in parallel, competing for memory cycles. To ensure orderly access to the shared memory, a memory controller synchronizes access to the memory.

### 1.2.1 Interrupts

#### 1.2.1.1 Overview

* Hardware may trigger an interrupt at any time by sending a signal to the CPU, usually by way of the system bus. 

* Interrupts are used for many other purpose as well and are a key part of how operating system and hardware interact.

* Operation

  > When the CPU is interrupted, it stops what it is doing and immediately transfers execution to a fixed location.
  >
  > The fixed location usually contains the starting address where the service routine for the interrupt is located. 
  >
  > The interrupt service routine executes.
  >
  > On completion, the CPU resumes the interrupted computation.

  A timeline of this operation is shown in Figure 1.3.

* The interrupt architecture must also save the state information of whatever was interrupted, so that it can restore this information after serving the interrupt.
* After the interrupt is serviced, the saved return address is loaded into the program counter, and the interrupted computation resumes as though the interrupt had not occurred. 

#### 1.2.1.2 Implementation

* Most CPUs have two interrupt request lines. One is the **nonmaskable** interrupt, which is reserved for events such as unrecoverable memory errors. The second interrupt line is **maskable**: it can be turned off by the CPU before the execution of critical instruction sequences that must not be interrupted. The maskable interrupt is used by device controllers to request service.
* Figure 1.5 illustrates the design of the interrupt vector for Intel processors. The events from 0 to 31, which are nonmaskable, are used to signal various error conditions. The events from 32 to 255, which are maskable, are used for purposes such as device-generated interrupts.

* **Summary** 

  > Interrupts are used throughout modern operating systems to handle asynchronous events(and for other purpose we will discuss throughout the text). 
  >
  > Device controllers and hardware faults raise interrupts.
  >
  > To enable the most urgent work to be done first, modern computers uses a system of interrupt priorities.
  >
  > Because interrupt are used so heavily for time-sensitive processing, efficient interrupt handling is required for good system performance.

### 1.2.2 Storage Structure

* The first program to run on computer power-on is a **bootstrap program**, which then loads the operating system.
* A kilobyte, or KB, is 1024 bytes. Computer manufacturers often round off these numbers and say that a megabyte is 1 million bytes and a gigabyte is 1 billion bytes. Networking measurements are an exception to this general rule; they are given in bits(because networks move data a bit at a time).
* The proper management of secondary storage is of central importance to a computer system.
* Those that are slow enough and large enough that they are used only for special purposes — to store backup copies of material stored on other devices, for example — are called **tertiary storage**.

* **Summary** 

  > The design of a complete storage system mast balance all the factors just discussed: it must use only as much expensive memory as necessary while providing as much inexpensive, nonvolatile storage as possible. Caches can be installed to improve performance where a large disparity in access time or transfer rate exists between two components.

### 1.2.3 I/O Structure

* A large portion of operating system code is dedicated to managing I/O, both because of its importance to the reliability and performance of a system and because of the varying nature of the devices.
* The form of interrupt-driven I/O described in [Section 1.2.1](#1.2.1 Interrupts) is fine for moving small amounts of data but can produce high overhead when used for bulk data movement such as NVS I/O. To solve this problem,  **direct memory access(DMA)** is used.
* After setting up buffers, pointers, and counters for the I/O device, the device controller transfers an entire block of data directly to or from the device and main memory, with no intervention by the CPU. Figure 1.7 shows the interplay of all components of a computer system.

## 1.3 Computer-System Architecture

A computer system can be organized in a number of different ways, which we can categorize roughly according to the number of general-purpose processors used.

### 1.3.1 Single-Processor Systems

* The **core** is the component that executes instructions and registers for storing data locally. 
* All of these special-purpose processors run a limited instruction set and do not run processes.
* The operating system cannot communicate with these processors; they do their jobs autonomously.

### 1.3.2 Multiprocessor Systems

* The processors share the computer bus and sometimes the clock, memory, and peripheral devices.

* The speed-up ratio with *N* processors is not *N*, however, it is less than *N*.
* The most common multiprocessor system use **symmetric multiprocessing(SMP)**, in which each peer CPU processor performs all tasks, including operating-system functions and user processes. Figure 1.8 illustrates a typical SMP architecture with two processors, each with its own CPU.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wholon/image@main/uPic/image-20201207200006199.png" alt="image-20201207200006199" style="zoom: 25%;" />

* In Figure 1.9, we show a dual-core design with two cores on the same processor chip.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wholon/image@main/uPic/image-20201207200320443.png" alt="image-20201207200320443" style="zoom: 25%;" />

* The CPUs are connected by a **shared system interconnect**, so that all CPUs share one physical address space. This approach — known as **non-uniform memory access(NUMA)** is illustrated in Figure 1.10.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wholon/image@main/uPic/image-20201207200628245.png" alt="image-20201207200628245" style="zoom: 33%;" />

* Because NUMA systems can scale to accommodate a large number of processors, they are being increasing popular on servers as well as high-performance computing systems.

### 1.3.3 Clustered Systems

* The generally accepted definition is that clustered computers share storage and are closely linked via a local-area network LAN or a faster interconnect, such as InfiniBand.
* Clustering is usually used to provide **high-availability service** — that is, service that will continue even if one or more systems in the cluster fail.
* The users and clients of the applications see only a brief interruption of service.
* Since a cluster consists of several computer systems connected via a network, clusters can also be used to provide **high-performance computing** environments. Figure 1.11 depicts the general structure of a clustered system.
