2020-11-13-Your-learning-workflow.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'Your learning workflow as Data Scientist.', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['Data Science', 'General']}","Hey! I really wanted to do this guide, it's very promising. I will tell you just the things you need to know to become a Data Scientist. There are a few, but listen, because this can save you a lot of time and put you straightforward to the top. As always, I don't  want to extend introductions so much, so here we go.

## Working and Networking: Key concepts

My experience as a Freelancer has opened my eyes. You really need a job. Or a project. Or to do something with what you've learned. You don't really want to stay in courses, getting extra-information, and paying them for staying where you are. I say this because, at least, in DS there are plenty of businesses and websites built around the concept of preparing you for the scene. But there is no scene behind. Even if they promise you an interview, they agree them with companies, and even they
agree with companies to hire a couple of persons that they require.

Key concepts are:

- **Working:** Nowadays, Data Scientists with some experience are required to get hired. Experience is a must in order to get a job. This happens because the offer has equalized the demand. In the earlier stages, there was so much demand that even mathematicians ,physicians and tech-related careers were applying for jobs in DS. But due to the growing demand on the 21st century, the offer has already grown up to equiparate. And now, the bottleneck is applying to each candidate in each job candidate hunting. Details matter, a lot! Don't let yourself getting fooled by some company and lose your time and your money. Just get money while you grow up and build an interesting portfolio. That's the way.

- **Networking:** The key of becoming an effective learner on Data Science (and I suspect, in most other topics), is networking. You must go through the network, read posts, contribute, etc. You will never want to do this alone, and you're not alone at all. In fact, networking is a great way to do contacts, stay informed on new jobs and projects, and keep yourself updated. Never underestimate this. 

## Communities: Top 5

1. **Reddit:** Reddit can be considered the `MetaCommunity`, this is, the community of communities. It has all you want to know, people are kind and best answers are voted and remain, although bad ones are just considered comments and not getting punished.

    In fact, what makes Reddit unique is it's discussion soul. When you are a beginner on something and you really want to know, just surf the Reddit communities related, trying to find information from the best topics.

    Example: You need to know about R. You know nothing. You go to `r/Rlanguage`, click on `Top` messages, and you'll find out really quickly an HTML book called [`R for Data Science`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), indeed the best book over there to start learning and a reference when you need to know about R in general (although the author refer to more advanced books). You have it!

2. **Stackoverflow:** StackOverflow can be considered the Q&A (Questions and Answers) community for programmers by default/standard. Not only all the posts are forced and rewarded to be clearly expressed, but also all the answers have to be answering the whole thing. There is a very good system to penalyze people for posting semi-answers, link-answers, harassment, etc. Also, growing up in reputation is a little bit harder. If you don't know the complete answer to something, it's better not to post, because you'll likely receive downvotes and bans.

    Use the `meta-searcher` to search through your topics and quickly find interesting questions to help you out. The are a number of options you can use as filter in the search bar, like `[], user: answers: score:` and much more.

3. **StackExchange:** As I said StackOverflow was top of the programming environment, it's popularity raised too much due to their system and ease of use. This maid StackOverflow leaders to think about growing up the community and extend to the rest of topics, leaving StackOverflow.com as an option to ""Only-programmers"". This way, *StackExchange* was born. This combines the generality of topics like in ""Reddit"", but also keeps safe the ""StackOverflow"" behaviour of Q&A, search bar, reward/punish system and a integration with ""StackOverflow.com"". To be honest, I didn't search much through it, but I recognise this is quite useful to split topics and make you search efficiently.

4. **GitHub:** Ok, you can turn down your computer, go take a glass of water, then turn back. What you have read until now it's nothing. You just go to GitHub and start over there. **GitHub** is a `must` between programmers. I will list the advantages of knowing `GitHub` and the control version program associated, `git`:

    - Control version to your projects.
    - Infinite private repositories -> Filesystem storage, free.
    - Free to use.
    - Largest community and standard to communicate, share projects, find other projects and software (even of big companies), and fork projects.
    - Store scripts and pieces of information in your `Gists`.
    - Star and follow people and projects, you have the reference to come back in the future.
    - Tracking of issues, development, ...,aided with the community support.

    Probably, everything you need is hosted in a public GitHub repository. There are many books, resources, lists, programs, enhancements, topics, users...

    Just use GitHub.

5. **Google:** As every good tech. person says, ""Google is your best friend"", or at least ""Google is your friend, not your enemy"". Well, the problem with Google is just that it is so ""f\*\*"" big, but it manages to make things happen to you. What you find in the top 10 pages from a Google search, is 80\% of times what you need to find. And if you find difficult to find something, you can personalize your queries with keywords (i.e. ""allinurl:, type:, insite:"", etc.)

    Another big aspect of Google that people tend to underestimate, is it's versatility. Data Scientists must know that Google is a big big company that doesn't provide only a searcher through the web. It provides much more value.
    
    - **Google Colaboratory:** A ""Jupyter Notebooks"" site that allows you free GPU/TPU usage, as well as sharing notebooks and storing them in Google Drive.
    - **Google Scholar:** A personal favorite of mine, Google Scholar is a great way to keep up to date with academic research and progress in science and technology. Easily and quickly search across masses of scholarly literature from one place.
    - **Google Drive:** Ok, we just had GitHub for this storage purpose, but ""Google Drive"" is much more visual and straightforward to manage, and intends to have full Google integration with other features.
    - **Google Maps:** Relating to services, geolocation, recommendations... Google Maps is absolutely amazing and a unique feature that only Google can develop. Just crazy stuff over there. Like many other things, it has API clients to allow you having the service for your programs/websites.
    - **Google Cloud Platform:** A Cloud Platform that allows you to buy services at a good reasonable price. You can deploy kubernetes clusters, VMs, networks, start your applications, and much more stuff...
    - **Google Mail:** Yes, Gmail is a very good e-mail provider. Good integration with many other things, it can allocate apps (""Zoom, Hangouts, Calendar"") to make things easier for you. It also provides API to store and backup your emails or whatever... Thanks Google.
    - **Google Chrome:** A minimalist web browser. Personally I had tuned up Firefox, but Google Chrome will always have the `superGoogle` company behind, and you never regret calling `superGoogle` in your rescue.
    - **Google Play Services:** Just APPs for everyone in Android platforms and terminals. Your smartphones gets more smart.
    - **YouTube:** Google bought it. Nothing more to say. Look for tutorials, presentations, but don't lose time on it!

    And much more: [List of Google products.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products)


## My final Advice

In descending order:

0. **Abstract everything.** Try to focus just on your job and what you are doing. There are plenty of programs and options out there trying to abstract tech from execution. If something get's complicated, try an easier abstracted solution that works for you.
1. **Don't reinvent the wheel.** Somewhere out there has found a solution and posted it in some website or community. Google has done it for you, surely. Also, check GitHub and Reddit for this purpose. 
2. **Don't be greedy.** Trying to understand everything and/or pick the best option is just a pain in the ass. Since we are humans, we don't understand everything and we can't communicate things efectively. Don't build the final mega-cluster with everything included in it. It simply doesn't work and if you even achieve that, it will be created by someone else, put on a website, lately adquired by Google and served for free.
3. **Just search what you need, use what you must.** Keep things simple. Use your master in searching and symbolic linking.
4. **Respect communities.** People has spend a lot of time for you, and more. Respect and listen communities users on topics and experience. This guide is an example of it. Respect it.
5. **Be official.** Instead of searching for everything in web posts, follow point `3` and try to understand official documentation and how to use it. It will provide an improved way of searching and overview for things, along with keeping versioning diffs. If you need more details or understand something, I suggest going for ""Reddit/StackOverflow/Youtube"" sites. Transparences are just so useful to transmit concepts. Talks are useful to get a general idea of how things work.
6. **Be a human.** What computers need, it is a human. It is good to be humans and sense by humans. Computers are stupid machines, even with ML/DL. They do what they are told to do, but they do what they do extremely well. The last thing you want is becoming a half-human or a semi-machine, because that way you are not providing the machines the kind of support they need in order to obtain the maximum potential.

Best of luck!"

### What is Docker?
Docker is a technology that build, serve and deploy containers. You can think of Docker as a boss, that boss distributes the employers, and send employers to other sites to do what they have to do. The employers are the containers, ofc.

Containers have large list of advantages, some that come out to my mind are:

- Isolation
- Interoperability
- Ease of deployment
- Ease of serve
- Modular
- Extensible (to infinity)
- Exportable

In fact, you can use and deploy all your applications in your local system as services. Docker is all about services and containers. 

The only requisites I would say to be important, are:

- **Good Storage capacity:** This allows you to store more images in order to run them in containers.
- **Good Internet connection:** This allows you to quickly pull images from the Docker service, run them in your operating system, and remove images.

### Docker 

1. [**Install Docker:**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. **Pull Images:**

    `docker pull mysql`

3. **Run Images in Containers:**

    `docker run mysql` + optional parameters for the first run

4. **Stop/Start Containers as services:**

    `docker start <name>`
    `docker stop <name>`

    with ""\<name\>"" being the name automatically given to your container.

5. Keep them synced with in your `DockerHub` account, exploy others containers, deploy them in your machine, build your custom container from others ones, etc.

And that's all. You only need to remember a piece. Possibilities are endless.

Best of luck!"
2020-11-13-AdvPython-basic-blocks.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['Python', 'tutorial', 'advanced'], 'title': 'Advanced Python: The basic blocks of everything.'}","Hey! I really think this tutorial is good stuff for you. Maybe you've been years using Python or you are just a beginner, but you get struggled when you try to understand how things work in Python, you don't understand docs and you get lost very quickly when you try to advance in Python. This guide is for you. Also, I recommend reading this even if you are a very advanced Python programmer, as well as basic user, you will understand why very quickly.

Without more preables, let's tackle it.

## The basic blocks: Classes and Functions.

""Classes and Functions"", ""Classes and Functions""... repeat 10 times more. You get it. Because all things in Python are objects, and those objects are divided (in a general way), into classes and functions.

### Classes
Classes have the following characteristics:

- Store objects in them. These could be other instance of classes (called **attributes**) or functions (called **methods**).
- Serve as templates. They instantiate objects belonging to the original class by calling it's **constructor** ().
- Can heredate from other classes. You can call ""Parent"" or ""Child"" class attending this hierarchy. Child classes heredate all attributes and methods from parent classes.

Classes have the following components:

- **Methods:** Functions inside the class. They can be:
    1. **Dunder methods:** They have a special meaning for Python. They are methods that interact's with Python internal built-in system, and implements some general functionality. I.e.: __init__(),__add__(),__exit__(). They have double underscores surrounding a verb.
    2. **Routine methods:** They .They can be called as you want, but by conventions, it is a good practice to call them as **verbs**. I.e.: get_something(), get_name, get_attribute(), etc. By the way, the ""get_something"" methods are calling ""getters"". You will find more of these practices by a little of thinking process about them.
- **Attributes:** Attributes are objects attached to the class. They are usually instances, but you could attach subclasses (i.e. 'self.num = 1' defines an attribute called ""num"").

Classes are defined by this syntax done by pseudo-code:

```
class my_Class(<parent_class (opt)>):
    def __init__(self,<other_arguments (opt)>):
        self.<some_attribute_name> = <object_got_by_calling_constructor> 
        <return_sentence (opt)>
    
    # attribute <some_attribute_name>
    <some_attribute_name> = <object>
    
    # method <some_function_name>
    def <some_function_name>(self, <other_arguments (opt)>):
        self.<attribute1> = <object>
        self.<attribute2> = <function_call>(<arguments>)
        return self.<attribute>    

# Instantiation:
obj = my_Class()

# Reference to methods/attributes:
obj.<method>
obj.<attribute>
```

These explanations can be extended much more, and made more rigurous, but we assume you know already how to code a class, define the __init__() method and instantiate an object. You can find this out in almost every rounded Python tutorial, as [this one.](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python).

### Functions

Functions have the following characteristics:

Functions have the following components:

- **Name.** The name is only an alias to access the object, as any object in Python. You call the function like `function(arguments)`.
- **Input.** Inputs define a map between the *GLOBAL NAMESPACE* and the *LOCAL NAMESPACE*. This defines a level of abstraction and accesibility (in classes we do not have this, except from methods, which are functions attached) and you can take advantage of this. You can vary the objects to pass to the function at execution time (when you call `function(argument=any_object)`). Also, it's optional to have input, you can just gather a set of instructions and put them together in a function and not care all about how it was done. 

    Input is the collection of arguments. There are different types of arguments that should be placed in order:
        1. default arguments: ""args"". def f(arg1=1, arg2=2). They are defined in the definition of the function, and although you change their value, the remain being that value if you don't call them explicitly.
        2. keyword arguments: or ""kwargs"". f(arg1=1, arg2=2). They don't need to respect position because they are called through mapping (=) 
        3. positional arguments: ""args"". f(1, 2, 3). They are placed in index-order into the function local namespace. 
        4. arbitrary positional arguments. def f(*args). They are packed into the local namespace (as a tuple), when the function is called. * is splat operator.
        5. arbitrary keyword arguments. def f(**kwargs). They take the mappings defined in a dictionary and adopt that namespace when the function is called. ** is double_splat operator.

- **Internal structure.** You can place transformations, scripts, and whatsoever, inside a function. Your goal is to abstract a series of instructions and get the output of them done by simply calling the function. For the internal structure, you use a **LOCAL NAMESPACE**, which you can't access out of the function. You only can access the output of a function by calling the function outside (i.e. '\<out\> = \<function_name\>(\<arguments\>)' ). You can also set ""global \<object\>""
    inside a function to declare it globally.
- **Output.** There is always an `Output`, although it can be ""None"". 'return <something>' will return the output and exit the function. Outputs are generally stored as alias with the assign operator = (i.e. `my_output =  my_function(arguments)`).


```
def my_Function(a,b=2):  # Input, arguments
    out = a + b         # Internal structure/instructions
    return out          # Output

my_Function(1,1) # Outputs 2, placed by order into local namespace

my_Function(1,b=1) # Also outputs 2
my_Function(a=1,b=1)

my_Function(1) # Outputs 3, b was default argument

args=[10,10]
my_Function(*args) #Outputs 20

kwargs = { ""a"":10, 
           ""b"":10,
           }
my_Function(**kwargs)  # Outputs 20
```

## Once you understand this...

Ok, for an intermediate/advanced Python guy, what I've said until now is just obvious. 

A real advanced Pythoner guy is, of course, much more than this. But internally, he doesn't know much more than what I've just told before. The difference resides in details: advanced Python users **DO KNOW** the details of the basic python types, while intermediate users **DON'T**.

A typical intermediate user will find ""3rd party/some external"" library doing what they want to do in a simple way and exclaim ""Hey!, I've just done it, I'm pro."". Another example is that they try to make an overcomplicated function by themselves that often works magically.

A advanced user would try to do the job by simply using **methods** and **classes** from *built-in* Python. If they find it difficult or need more help, they could be looking for some libraries in the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). This is because these libraries have full integration with each other, and you will not be exhausting your possibilities or reaching incompatibles within your code.

There are some few external libraries that are **CORE** for Python. This is because they extend their functionality far away. A few of them are:

- NumPy: numpy, numpy as np
- Matplotlib: matplotlib , matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- Pandas: pandas, pandas as pd
- SciPy : scipy, scipy as sp
- Statsmodels: statsmodels, statsmodels as sm
- Scikit-learn: sklearn, from sklearn import *
- Tensorflow: tensorflow, tensorflow as tf

It is totally ok to use these core libraries as they are far well documented, supported and developed.

## Reading a documentation:

What an advanced Python user does when learning a new library is:

1. Going to the official documentation of that library.
2. They read the **Overview**. 
3. They try to make a little understanding of the main classes of that library. These classes are usually super-classes for other classes defined by hereditance, and they are usually enough to achieve most purposes.
4. They figure out basic methods of the super-classes. They know the ""get"", ""set"", ""from"", ""to"" and other verbs defining methods in relation to attributes.
5. They get hands on it!

This is the super-power I hope you develop by reading this guide. The power of Python is simplified by the interface of ""Classes/Functions"" it has. You just can reach a module or a topic you didn't even know nothing about and end up having good understanding of it.

Best of luck!"
2020-11-13-AdvPython-Complete-tutorial.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['Python', 'tutorial', 'advanced'], 'title': 'Advanced Python: Complete tutorial'}","Hey! This time I came with a new and complete tutorial, for everything in Python that I consider ""advanced"". If you have not read yet `Advanced Python: The basic blocks of everything`, check it out, because this guide is the II part.

As always, let's go to the heart of the matter.

## What great Pythoners know: Basic Python

###






## The must-know of [Standard Libraries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) outside the CORE.


### [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl.

Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings (str) as well as 8-bit strings (bytes). However, Unicode strings and 8-bit strings cannot be mixed: that is, you cannot match a Unicode string with a byte pattern or vice-versa; similarly, when asking for a substitution, the replacement string must be of the same type as both the pattern and the search string.


### [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation.

### [collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)
This module implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Python’s general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.

- namedtuple()
- deque
- ChainMap
- Counter
- OrderedDict
- defaultdict
- UserDict
- UserList
- UserString

### [enum](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html)
An enumeration is a set of symbolic names (members) bound to unique, constant values. Within an enumeration, the members can be compared by identity, and the enumeration itself can be iterated over.

### [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)
This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

These functions cannot be used with complex numbers; use the functions of the same name from the cmath module if you require support for complex numbers. The distinction between functions which support complex numbers and those which don’t is made since most users do not want to learn quite as much mathematics as required to understand complex numbers. Receiving an exception instead of a complex result allows earlier detection of the unexpected complex number used as a parameter, so that the programmer can determine how and why it was generated in the first place.

### [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.

For integers, there is uniform selection from a range. For sequences, there is uniform selection of a random element, a function to generate a random permutation of a list in-place, and a function for random sampling without replacement.

On the real line, there are functions to compute uniform, normal (Gaussian), lognormal, negative exponential, gamma, and beta distributions. For generating distributions of angles, the von Mises distribution is available.

### [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html)
This module implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML. Each has been recast in a form suitable for Python.

The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an “iterator algebra” making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.

### [functools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html)
The functools module is for higher-order functions: functions that act on or return other functions. In general, any callable object can be treated as a function for the purposes of this module.

### [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html)
The glob module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in arbitrary order. No tilde expansion is done, but \*, ?, and character ranges expressed with [] will be correctly matched. This is done by using the os.scandir() and fnmatch.fnmatch() functions in concert, and not by actually invoking a subshell. Note that unlike fnmatch.fnmatch(), glob treats filenames beginning with a dot (.) as special cases. (For tilde and shell variable expansion, use os.path.expanduser() and os.path.expandvars().)

### [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
This library allows you to write a bytestream into the filesystem, allowing you to store objects externally.

ML engineers used to store their large and training models and hiperparameters in this format, allowing them to recover the whole thing in a matter of seconds. Well, it's one of its many uses, but a good one.

```
import pickle
import numpy as np

my_array = np.random.randn(1000)
with open(""my_array.pkl"", ""wb"") as f:
    f.write(pickle.load(my_array))
```
### [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. If you just want to read or write a file see open(), if you want to manipulate paths, see the os.path module, and if you want to read all the lines in all the files on the command line see the fileinput module. For creating temporary files and directories see the tempfile module, and for high-level file and directory handling see the shutil module.

### [io](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html)
The io module provides Python’s main facilities for dealing with various types of I/O. There are three main types of I/O: text I/O, binary I/O and raw I/O. These are generic categories, and various backing stores can be used for each of them. A concrete object belonging to any of these categories is called a file object. Other common terms are stream and file-like object.


### [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html)
This module constructs higher-level threading interfaces on top of the lower level \_thread module. See also the \_queue module. This module provides low-level primitives for working with multiple threads (also called light-weight processes or tasks) \— multiple threads of control sharing their global data space. 

### [platform](https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html)
Access to underlying platform’s identifying data

### [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html)
It allows your machine to run code as it were the CLI.

### [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
asyncio is a library to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax.

asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries, distributed task queues, etc.

asyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level structured network code.

### [socket](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)
This module provides access to the BSD socket interface. It is available on all modern Unix systems, Windows, MacOS, and probably additional platforms.

### [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), specified by RFC 7159 (which obsoletes RFC 4627) and by ECMA-404, is a lightweight data interchange format inspired by JavaScript object literal syntax (although it is not a strict subset of JavaScript 1 ).

json exposes an API familiar to users of the standard library marshal and pickle modules.

### [html.parser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html)
This module defines a class HTMLParser which serves as the basis for parsing text files formatted in HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language) and XHTML.

class html.parser.HTMLParser(*, convert_charrefs=True)¶

### [xml.sax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.html)
The xml.sax package provides a number of modules which implement the Simple API for XML (SAX) interface for Python. The package itself provides the SAX exceptions and the convenience functions which will be most used by users of the SAX API.

### [urllib.request](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request) or [request](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
The urllib.request module defines functions and classes which help in opening URLs (mostly HTTP) in a complex world — basic and digest authentication, redirections, cookies and more.

### [locale](https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html)
The locale module opens access to the POSIX locale database and functionality. The POSIX locale mechanism allows programmers to deal with certain cultural issues in an application, without requiring the programmer to know all the specifics of each country where the software is executed.

The locale module is implemented on top of the \_locale module, which in turn uses an ANSI C locale implementation if available.

### [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems. (Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.)

Running python -m tkinter from the command line should open a window demonstrating a simple Tk interface, letting you know that tkinter is properly installed on your system, and also showing what version of Tcl/Tk is installed, so you can read the Tcl/Tk documentation specific to that version.

### [pydoc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html)
The pydoc module automatically generates documentation from Python modules. The documentation can be presented as pages of text on the console, served to a Web browser, or saved to HTML files.

### [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)
The module pdb defines an interactive source code debugger for Python programs. It supports setting (conditional) breakpoints and single stepping at the source line level, inspection of stack frames, source code listing, and evaluation of arbitrary Python code in the context of any stack frame. It also supports post-mortem debugging and can be called under program control.

The debugger is extensible – it is actually defined as the class Pdb. This is currently undocumented but easily understood by reading the source. The extension interface uses the modules bdb and cmd.

The debugger’s prompt is (Pdb).

### [distutils](https://docs.python.org/3/library/distutils.html)
The distutils package provides support for building and installing additional modules into a Python installation. The new modules may be either 100%-pure Python, or may be extension modules written in C, or may be collections of Python packages which include modules coded in both Python and C.

### [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)
This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It is always available.

### [contextlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html)
This module provides utilities for common tasks involving the with statement. For more information see also Context Manager Types and With Statement Context Managers.

### [inspect](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html)
The inspect module provides several useful functions to help get information about live objects such as modules, classes, methods, functions, tracebacks, frame objects, and code objects. For example, it can help you examine the contents of a class, retrieve the source code of a method, extract and format the argument list for a function, or get all the information you need to display a detailed traceback.

There are four main kinds of services provided by this module: type checking, getting source code, inspecting classes and functions, and examining the interpreter stack.

### [importlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html)
The purpose of the importlib package is two-fold. One is to provide the implementation of the import statement (and thus, by extension, the __import__() function) in Python source code. This provides an implementation of import which is portable to any Python interpreter. This also provides an implementation which is easier to comprehend than one implemented in a programming language other than Python.

Two, the components to implement import are exposed in this package, making it easier for users to create their own custom objects (known generically as an importer) to participate in the import process."
2020-11-04-metrics.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['ML', 'models', 'evaluation'], 'title': 'Metrics in Machine Learning.', 'mathjax': True}","We are often confused by explanations on what ML metrics really are or represent, this post is my attempt to clarify this question. I have developed a simple mentality when it comes to me thinking of those metrics, which one I pick to evaluate my models and why.

## Confusion Matrix:

When we think about the error predictions and errors, we might want to construct the confusion(truth) matrix of the model, which helps a lot visualizing it.


|      |           | **Predicted**  |          |
|      |           | **Positives** | **Negatives** |
| **Real** | **Positives** | TP        | FN |
|      | **Negatives** | FP        | TN |

Where the ""Positive""/""Negative"" word at the end corresponds to the predictions of the model over a target category. Quite often, if we work with a logical(binary) classifier, we tend to call ""True"" or ""False"" to one state or the other. When we have multiple classifiers, it applies the logic of ""one-vs-all"", in this case we must talk about one category being the ""True"" state, and the rest are ""False"" states.

## Types of errors in Supervised Learning:

- **Model err.** : This is the actual error of the model. This measures the ratio of the accurate predictions of the model (in each cathegory) between all.
- **Type I err.** : Also called FP (false positives). This is the error that the model introduces when it classifies an event belonging to our interest category (target classes), when in fact it is not.
- **Type II err.** : Also called FN (false negatives). This is the error that the model introduces when it classifies an event not belonging to our interest category (target classes), when it fact it is.

Once we understand those concepts, some metrics come along with.

## Metrics associated:

- (Model): 
$$ Accuracy = {True\_predictions \over All\_predictions } = {TP + TN \over TP + TN + FP + FN} $$
- (Type I): 
$$ Precision = {True\_predicted\_positives \over Predicted\_positives} = {TP \over TP+FP} $$
- (Type II):
$$ Recall = {True\_predicted\_positives \over Real\_positives} = {TP \over TP+FN} $$ 
- (Mix Type I/II): 
$$ F1\_score = { True\_predicted\_positives \over TP + Average\_of\_errors} =
{TP \over TP + 1/2(FP+FN)} =
{2 P*R \over P+R} $$


There are other derived metrics, but they are derived from the ones above and thus, we will not cover them here.

2020-11-04-Linear-Regression.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'Linear Regression - The simplest model', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['ML', 'models']}","In this article, we will talk about the simplest model we can apply to our data, a linear regression `LinearRegression()`. Remember, we talk about regression when our target variable is continuous, so that we are not predicting categories as in our `LogisticClassifier()`.

### Loading the dataset

[//]: # (Using RedCarpet as the syntax highlighter: Put the programming language after ```)
[//]: # (I prefer the ``` python method than the liquid  highlight python - endhighlight one. Much more readable in Vim + less stupid)
``` python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris# Load Iris Data

iris = load_iris()
iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data= iris.data, columns= iris.feature_names)
target_df = pd.DataFrame(data= iris.target, columns= ['species'])


target_df['species'] = target_df['species'].map({0:""setosa"", 1:""versicolor"", 2:""virginica""})        # apply map converter (dicts), alternatively: apply(function)  

iris_df = pd.concat([iris_df, target_df], axis= 1)      # concatenate the DataFrames 
```

we can get now a brief visual of the columns.

`iris_df.describe()`

.describe() generates descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of a dataset’s distribution, excluding `NaN` values.

`iris_df.info()`

.info() prints a concise summary of a DataFrame.

`sns.pairplot(iris_df, hue= 'species')`

### Problem Statement: Predict the sepal length (cm) of the iris flowers

Now, our objective is to predict the target `sepal length (cm)` using the rest of features. To do so, we have labeled the `species` column into a categorical variable, so our model can understand that in a non-number way. Remember, not all the models let us to do this technique.

``` python
# Converting Objects to Numerical dtype
iris_df.drop('species', axis= 1, inplace= True)
target_df = pd.DataFrame(columns= ['species'], data= iris.target)
iris_df = pd.concat([iris_df, target_df], axis= 1)# Variables
X= iris_df.drop(labels= 'sepal length (cm)', axis= 1)
y= iris_df['sepal length (cm)']

# Splitting the Dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size= 0.33, random_state= 101)

# Instantiating LinearRegression() Model
lr = LinearRegression()

# Training/Fitting the Model
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making Predictions
lr.predict(X_test)
pred = lr.predict(X_test)

# Evaluating Model's Performance
print('Mean Absolute Error:', mean_absolute_error(y_test, pred))
print('Mean Squared Error:', mean_squared_error(y_test, pred))
print('Mean Root Squared Error:', np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, pred)))
```

The results are:

```
Mean Absolute Error: 0.26498350887555133
Mean Squared Error: 0.10652500975036944
Mean Root Squared Error: 0.3263816933444176

2020-07-03-lc0-guia.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'Cómo instalar el engine “LeelaChessZero” (lc0) para su uso en cualquier interfaz de ajedrez.', 'tags': ['Chess', 'IA'], 'show_title': True}","Hola gente. Nuestro equipo ha decidido traer esta vez una guía sencilla, para instalar y configurar el motor de ajedrez conocido como LeelaChessZero o lc0.

Para poneros en contexto, este motor de ajedrez ha sido desarrollado siguiendo el paper original de AlphaZero, el cual es un motor de ajedrez que usa la inteligencia artificial (IA) en vez de patrones definidos por el programador, para aprender de sus propias partidas. Éste motor, como muchos ya sabréis, causó alta expectación en su día, tanto por superar a Stockfish como por su estilo de juego.

Pues bien, la reacción de la comunidad no se hizo esperar, y lanzó su propio proyecto de código abierto (LeelaChessZero) en el cual trabajan profesionales de la IA (y cualquier tipo de público en colaboración con ellos) para optimizar y entrenar la red neuronal que lo forma. Podéis encontrar los enlaces a este código más abajo en la guía.

Es importante que destaquemos las características de estos nuevos tipos de motores que usan IA basada en redes neuronales, en contra de los motores de análisis tradicionales.

### Características LC0 vs. traditionals:

- Basada en NNs (Neural Networks), y usan algoritmos de Deep Learning.

- Estas NNs necesitan ser entrenadas con sus propias partidas. Es decir, se deja que el motor juegue inicialmente contra sí mismo y vaya reajustando sus parámetros y su conocimiento de las posiciones a base de prueba-error (win / lose). En definitiva, se crea su propio estilo de juego desde 0.

- Estos parámetros (conocidos como pesos o “weights”), son entrenados, almacenables, exportables y reutilizables. Es decir, podríamos coger los pesos calculados por otro usuario, seguir entrenando la NN, mejorar los iniciales y guardar el resultado. Esto hace que en la actualidad, pocos motores puedan competir contra este tipo de aprendizaje. Hay una mejora constante y abierta a la comunidad.

- Puede nutrirse del análisis de partidas humanas. Para ésto, las plataformas de ajedrez que liberan/publican las partidas son útiles, en contraposición al material de pago que ofrece, por ejemplo, Chessbase (y su calaña).

- Está pensado para hacer uso de la GPU (la unidad gráfica de nuestro ordenador) para realizar cálculos a mucha más velocidad. Así, al ser un proyecto en el que puede aportar cualquier persona y hacer uso de su GPU ( ~ x100 veces la capacidad CPU con la que solemos usar el ordenador), tenemos el equivalente al mayor supercomputador pensado jamás para entrenar este motor de ajedrez.

Después de haber mencionado todo lo anterior, uno se puede hacer a la idea de porqué es interesante (y tanto) este motor de ajedrez. Sin más, vamos con la guía.

# GUÍA DE INSTALACIÓN:

El motor de ajedrez es un binario del sistema operativo en el que nos encontremos, y se debe cargar en cualquier interfaz de ajedrez a través de paneles como “Análisis”/”Analysis” ->”Cargar motor UCI”/”Load UCI engine”. Además de ésto, se necesita especificar el archivo de Pesos en la configuración del motor, a diferencia de otros motores tradicionales.

Lo primero que tenemos que tener en cuenta es qué sistema operativo poseemos, así dividiremos en los siguientes grupos:

### Windows:

Sus archivos binarios son conocidos por su extensión “.exe”, que se ejecutan al abrir éstos archivos. El motor de ajedrez se puede descargar en el enlace. Y sus pesos en éste enlace.

Los archivos comprimidos pueden contener código fuente del proyecto, por lo cual habría que buildear un binario “.exe” que añadiese ciertas funcionalidades en caso de ser necesario. Seguir leyendo el apartado “Linux”->”Compilar código fuente” para continuar el proceso general.

### Linux:

Una aclaración, es que Linux y sus derivados (Ubuntu, Fedora, RedHat, etc.) son los sistemas operativos que más se usan en software libre y por tanto, van en consonancia con la lógica del proyecto. En caso de que no poseáis una utilidad básica o programa necesitado por vuestro sistema(i.e. “git”), siempre podéis instalarlo desde vuestro gestor de paquetes (Google, bienvenido seas para ayudarme en esta ardua tarea). Podemos descargar los binarios a partir de archivos comprimidos llamados “tarballs” (.tar.gz), o bien compilar el código fuente del proyecto.

1. **Descargar comprimidos:**

    Click en el enlace para descargar. Una vez descargados, proseguir con:

    `tar -xzvf <nombre_del_archivo>.tar.gz`
    
    Y ya tendremos nuestro binario llamado “lc0”. Descargar el archivo de pesos en éste enlace.

2. **Compilar código fuente:**

    Aquí el enlace al repositorio de lc0 en GitHub.

    `git clone https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0`

    Esto os creará la carpeta “lc0” con los contenidos del repositorio online, en el directorio donde hayáis ejecutado el comando.

    `cd ./lc0`

    Desde aquí lo más recomendable siempre es seguir la guía de instalación, leyendo los archivos “README.md” o en su defecto, “INSTALL”. En el anexo de esta guía se ofrecerán referencias para poder construir el binario de manera que sea capaz de ejecutar el motor en GPU. Para instalar el binario compatible con CPU, se siguen los siguientes pasos:

    Se instalan las dependencias necesarias marcadas por el proyecto. Una vez instaladas las dependencias, ejecutamos.

    `./build.sh`

    Y nos creará el binario en:

    `cd ./build/release`

    llamado “lc0”. Éste será el archivo que necesitaremos cargar. El archivo de pesos se puede descargar en éste enlace.

### Mac OS:

Para los sistemas operativos de la empresa Apple, como Mac OS, podemos seguir la compilación del código fuente como en el caso explicado antes de Linux, con la particularidad de que los compiladores que instalemos de nuestro gestor de paquetes lo harán en nuestra arquitectura de ordenador. Simplemente, se seguirá el proceso igual que en “Linux”->”Compilar código fuente”, y en el caso de faltar librerías o programas necesarios para la compilación, se instalarán desde el gestor de paquetes nativo (brew).

## ANEXO 1. POST-INSTALACIÓN (opcional).

Hay varias opciones adicionales que podemos tener en cuenta de manera general en el proceso post-instalación:

- Añadir los binarios a la variable PATH del sistema. De esta forma, podemos ejecutar los comandos sin estar presentes en la carpeta donde se encuentren. En Windows, se procede editando la variable PATH del sistema y añadiendo la ruta (la carpeta donde se encuentran) de los binarios. En Linux, se puede editar el fichero “~/.bashrc” añadiendo lo siguiente:

`export PATH=$PATH:<ruta_de_los_binarios>`


## ANEXO 2. COMPATIBILIDAD CON GPU (opcional).

Para el caso en que queramos compatibilidad con la poderosa GPU (lo cual puede ser muy útil para el entrenamiento del modelo y para cálculos congelados, es decir, aquellos en los que tenemos una posición del tablero fija y dejamos la máquina pensar un tiempo razonable), debemos seguir los pasos marcados en el repositorio oficial para el sistema operativo correspondiente.

A grandes rasgos, hay que tener en cuenta los siguientes pasos:

1. Comprobar si nuestro ordenador posee una GPU compatible con CUDA. CUDA es una tecnología de aceleración que permite a nuestro ordenador utilizar los recursos de la GPU originalmente destinados a cálculo de gráficos, a procesos de la CPU normal. CUDA es específico de las gráficas Nvidia, pero hoy en día su uso está tan extendido que es poco probable que no tengamos una GPU de Nvidia. Podemos consultar las GPU que soportan CUDA en éste enlace.
2. En caso afirmativo de lo anterior, instalar el driver de GPU que corresponda al más actualizado y que soporte tu gráfica.
3. Instalar CUDA-toolkit. Podemos hacerlo a través de la página oficial de CUDA, o a través de línea de comandos del sistema: `sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit`
4. Compilar de nuevo el código fuente de “lc0”, ésta vez con las opciones que soporten CUDA, tal como se guía en el README.md del proyecto oficial en GitHub.

-------------------------------
Espero que este post os sea útil y que os aventuréis a probar este nuevo motor de análisis. Estoy seguro de que no os defraudará."
2016-12-26-algo-de-cuerdas.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'Algo de cuerdas', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['Physics']}","Hola gente. Vengo a contaros más o menos, una pequeña introducción intuitiva sobre teoría de cuerdas, cuáles fueron sus orígenes, porqué se escucha en todos lados sobre ella y qué nos aporta a la comprensión de la física hoy en día.

En primer lugar, la teoría de cuerdas es una teoría bastante antigua, aproximadamente tiene un siglo desde su nacimiento. En ella, se postula la existencia de cuerdas muy diminutas que cruzan el universo, cuyos modos de vibración determinan las partículas elementales: quarks, neutrinos, electrones, fotones, bosón de Higgs... que conocemos hoy en día lo que se conoce como el Modelo Estándar. De forma que cuanto mayor sea la frecuencia de oscilación, mayor energía estará asociada a ese modo y mayor será la masa de las partículas involucradas. Del mismo modo, partículas sin masa como el fotón están asociadas a vibraciones muy ligeras de estas cuerdas.

Hay dos tipos de cuerdas: abiertas o cerradas. Cuerdas abiertas pueden unirse en sus extremos para formar cuerdas cerradas. Éstas interacciones corresponden a diagramas de partículas , como los diagramas de Feynmann que conocemos. Hay diferentes órdenes de corrección para las interacciones de cuerdas, al igual que para las partículas puntuales en teoría cuántica de campos. La ventaja es que estos diagramas no contienen infinitos, como sí que ocurrían en los loops a órdenes >1 en los diagramas de Feynmann.

Las cuerdas poseen una llamada simetría conforme , por la cual hay dos puntos que son exactamente iguales. La condición para que no se rompa esta simetría por efectos cuánticos, es que las cuerdas deben vivir en ...26 dimensiones. La verdad es que parecen muchas para las que somos capaces de imaginar.

Sin embargo, esta primera teoría de cuerdas presentaba algunos problemas. Quizá los mayores problemas venían de parte de que ese modelo no contenía a los fermiones, y de que necesitaba la existencia de taquiones (partículas que viajan hacia atrás en el tiempo).

Para ello, se creó una teoría basada en la anterior llamada teoría de supercuerdas, que además, contiene oscilaciones fermiónicas. Entramos ya en la década de los 70 , con figuras como Ramond, Neveu y Schwarz. Conseguimos eliminar el problema de los fermiones y taquiones, pero a cambio hemos metido una nueva simetría , llamada ""Supersimetría"", por la cual cada partícula elemental tiene su compañera supersimétrica , e incluso más de una. Se descubre ahora que las cuerdas deben tener 10 dimensiones, parece que nos quitamos bastantes de encima. Una de las premisas de la teoría de cuerdas era que, debíamos intentar reconciliar la ""Mecánica Cuántica"" con la ""Relatividad General"", ya que sus leyes parecen entrar en contradicción cuando se analizan con más detenimiento. Para ello debíamos unificar todas las fuerzas en una sola.

Siguiendo con nuestras cuerdas, las cuerdas cerradas pueden girar hacia derecha dextrógiras o hacia la izquierda levógiras.También podrían ser abiertas o cerradas. Además, hay dos tipos de oscilaciones fermiónicas : ψc o ψs .Ésto nos lleva a una clasificación de los distintos tipos de teoría de supercuerdas, para estudiar las consecuencias más adelante y ver si se adecúan a las predicciones teóricas:

## TIPOS DE CUERDAS:

### Tipo IIA: 
Cuerdas cerradas , los modos levógiro y dextrógiro no son iguales : ψc y ψs
### Tipo IIB: 
Cuerdas cerradas, los modos levógiro y dextrógiro son iguales: ψs y ψs
### Tipo I:
Cuerdas abiertas y cuerdas cerradas noorientables
### Heteróticas: 
Cuerdas cerradas. Un modo fermiónico y el otro sólo bosónico.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Las comentamos:

- **Tipo II :** Dan lugar a teorías basadas en ""Supergravedad"", de 10 dimensiones, y donde el gravitón posee N=2 compañeros supersimétricos llamados ""gravitinos"". Sin embargo, en las cuerdas tipo IIB , ambos gravitinos son igualesmismaquiralidad, y en las IIA, quiralidad opuesta.
- **Tipo I:** Dan lugar a teorías basadas en ""Supergravedad"", de 10 dimensiones, y el gravitón posee N=1 compañero supersimétrico llamado ""gravitino"". La ventaja es que posee interacciones Gauge como el Modelo Estándar.

Hay ciertos problemas teóricos entre cómo los fermiones interactúan con los gravitones, y por ello, Edward Witten dió un paso al frente. Las teorías IIA no tienen problema porque el efecto de los dos gravitinos opuestos se cancela. Pero en los tipos IIB sí que hay un problema porque sus contribuciones se suman. Sin embargo en una teoría de cuerdas sin ""super"", éstos problemas se resuelven en IIB. En las de tipo I, se tienen anomalías extras que son de tipo gauge y que son insalvables, sin embargo, se descubrió que los problemas en las tipo I desaparecen en el grupo gauge SO32.

La teoría más prometedora parecía sin duda, la de cuerdas tipo I , la primera revolución de supercuerdas se dió en esta dirección, puesto que en principio parecía que unificaría Relatividad General, Mecánica Cuántica, y las interacciones gauge del Modelo Estándar. Por ello, pasó a llamarse ""la teoría del todo"", aquella que pretendía explicar todas las fuerzas de la naturaleza en una y ser la teoría definitiva de la naturaleza. Pero al mismo tiempo, se desarrollaron las teorías de cuerdas tipo Heteróticas, que contenían un compañero supersimétrico del gravitón, 10 dimensiones, y contenían interacciones gauge. Éstas se dividen a su vez en HE  grupo de simetría E8×E8 y las HO gupo SO(32).

Parece que nos quedan al final 5 tipos de supercuerdas, las IIB y IIA, las I y las Heteróticas tipo HE y HO. Para encajar las 10 dimensiones en el puzzle , Kaluza y Klein inventaron una idea matemática, basada en la concepción de 6 dimensiones extra diminutas que podemos asignar a cada punto del espacio,acurrucadas en una variedad compacta. Siendo tan pequeñas, sólo podríamos apreciarlas en experimentos a altas energías. Las variedades candidatas, son aquellas que satisfacen las ecuaciones de supergravedad, un tipo de ellas son las llamadas ""Calabi-Yau"", y tienen la propiedad de que no rompen la supersimetría de la teoría de cuerdas. Para cada variedad ""Calabi-Yau"", tendremos una teoría distinta en 4 dimensiones con distinto contenido de partículas, y distintos parámetros.

El reto consistía ahora en obtener una variedad CY tal que se obtenga el modelo Estándar o su versión SUSY , supersimétrica. Pero claro, ésto se convirtió en la búsqueda de muchos , pero nadie encontró nada, mientras tanto se olvidaron de las otras teorías de cuerdas. Pero pronto llegaría la segunda revolución de supercuerdas...

Y ésto es todo por hoy, ha sido denso, pero continuaré en otro post para hacer la lectura más agradable.

2016-12-20-string-theory.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'String Theory: Progress and Problems', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['Physics']}","String theory became a hot subject in the mid-1980s when it became clear that it might give a deeper understanding of the origins of the standard model and a consistent quantum theory containing gravity. At that time five consistent string theories were known, each of which requires ten spacetime dimensions and supersymmetry. They are called:

`Type I, Type IIA, Type IIB`

`SO(32) heterotic, E8 × E8 heterotic`

Each of these theories is entirely free of adjustable dimensionless parameters. All dimensionless parameters arise in either of two possible ways:

- dynamically as the expectation values of scalar fields
- as integers that count something such as topological invariants, physical objects (branes), or quantized fluxes.

One scheme looked particularly promising in the mid-1980s. Specifically, the E8 × E8 heterotic theory has consistent vacuum solutions in which six spatial dimensions form a compact Calabi–Yau manifold, which has SU(3) holonomy, and the other four dimensions form Minkowski spacetime [4]. Thus, the ten-dimensional spacetime M10 is a direct product

`M10 = CY6 × M3,1`

The effective four-dimensional theories that characterize such solutions at low energies have the following attractive features:

- They have the structure of supersymmetric grand unified theories. The well-known advantages of low-energy supersymmetry and grand unification are therefore naturally incorporated.

- Each solution has a definite number of families of quarks and leptons determined by the topology of the CY space.

- The standard model gauge symmetry is embedded in one E8 factor, and there is a hidden sector, associated to the second E8 factor. Supersymmetry can break dynamically (by gluino condensation) in the hidden sector. This breaking is communicated gravitationally to the visible sector. Such schemes suppress unwanted flavor-changing neutral currents, though possibly not as much as is required.

- There are several good dark-matter candidates: The lightest supersymmetric particle, called the LSP (perhaps a neutralino) is absolutely stable if there is an unbroken R symmetry, as generally supposed to be the case. A stable neutralino has the right properties for weakly interacting cold dark matter (a WIMP). Other possibilities include gravitinos, axions, and hidden-sector particles. Despite the exuberance that was in the air in 1985,1 there was much that was not yet understood. The successes were qualitative, and there were many problems and puzzling questions. Some of these problems and questions were the following:

- Hundreds of Calabi–Yau manifolds were known (now there are many thousands). Which one of them, if any, is the right one? Is there a principle (other than agreement with observations) by which the right one can be determined? Are there string-theory based schemes other than CY compactification of the E8 × E8 heterotic theory that can give quasi-realistic solutions?

- Why are there four other consistent superstring theories? After all, we only need one fundamental theory. Are some of them inconsistent, or else, could some of them somehow be equivalent?

- The CY compactification scenario was analyzed using perturbation theory, but there is no good reason to believe that the string coupling should be small. What new nonperturbative features appear at strong coupling? Does the same qualitative picture continue to hold at strong coupling?

- The CY solutions typically give many massless scalars (called moduli). Since the moduli have gravitational strength interactions, they are ruled out by standard tests of GR. How can we get rid of them? The effective potential does not depend on the values of the moduli, so they describe flat directions. One should somehow stabilize the moduli by generating an effective potential with isolated minima and no flat directions.

- What ensures that the vacuum energy density (or dark energy) is sufficiently small, namely of order 10−120 in Planck units? In 1985 it was generally believed to be zero, so one popular idea was to look for a symmetry principle that would enforce this. It is just as well that such a symmetry was never found, since we now know that the vacuum energy density is not exactly zero. A generic nonsupersymmetric vacuum is expected"

Vengo a probar un poco de nuevas cómo es colocar ecuaciones en HTML a Latex , de momento me voy acostumbrando. Y voy a aprovechar para hablaros de conceptos fundamentales de relatividad general. Aunque de más está decir que no seguiré esta saga en orden cronológico en un principio, aunque más tarde lo haré.

¿Os acordáis cuando definíamos la norma relacionada con la distancia de un vector ?

$$|s| = \sqrt{s^2} = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} = \sqrt{\rho^2 + z^2} = r $$

Algo análogo a ésto en un lenguaje más complicado es:

$$ds^2=g^{\mu\nu}dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu}= dx_{\mu}dx^{\mu}$$

Donde teníamos nuestra métrica euclidiana en 3D , las típicas x , y , z.

$$g^{\mu\nu}= \left(\begin{array}{1cr} 
 1 & 0 & 0  \\ 
0 & 1 & 0  \\ 
 0 & 0 & 1\\ 
\end{array}\right)$$

Bien , en relatividad especial y general, se trata al tiempo como una más de estas coordenadas, lógicamente para que el tiempo tenga dimensión de longitud, se multiplicará por una velocidad. ¿Cuál? . Por motivos intrínsecos a la misma teoría, se escoge la velocidad de la luz en el vacío $$c = 3*10^9 m/s$$

$$\eta^{\mu\nu}= \left(\begin{array}{1cr} 
 -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\ 
\end{array}\right)$$

Tenemos aquí la llamada métrica plana de Minkowski. Nos relaciona la estructura del espacio −1 , con el resto de componentes espaciales 1. Las distancias aquí no son lo que llamábamos antes la raíz cuadrada del cuadrado de las componentes en 3D , cuando sólo teníamos esos unos en la métrica.


Para $$x^\mu=\left(\begin{array}{1cr} ct \\ x \\ y \\ z \\ \end{array} \right)= \left(\begin{array}{1cr} x^0 \\ x^1 \\ x^2 \\ x^3 \\ \end{array} \right)$$


Ahora $$ds^2=\eta^{\mu\nu}dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu}= -(ct)^2+x^2+y^2+z^2$$

Y es más, ésta ""distancia"" entre dos sucesos es invariante ,es decir, no cambia.

Podemos hacer una clasificación entre trayectorias posibles que podríamos encontrarnos.

$$−(ct)^2+x^2+y^2+z^2<0$$ trayectoria de género tiempo 

$$−(ct)^2+x^2+y^2+z^2=0$$ trayectoria género luz 

$$−(ct)^2+x^2+y^2+z^2>0$$, trayectoria género espacio 

Podréis adivinar que las partículas con masa siguen trayectorias de género tiempo. Aquellas que no tienen masa, como el fotón, siguen trayectorias de género luz. Y partículas teóricas , como los taquiones , que viajan hacia ""atrás en el tiempo"", poseen trayectorias de género espacio.

Esto es todo por hoy, en otro post discutiremos los postulados de la relatividad general.

2016-12-14-ondas-gravitatorias.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'Ondas gravitatorias', 'show_title': True, 'mathjax': True}","Hola gente. Vengo hoy a explicaros qué es eso de las ondas gravitatorias y porqué se habla tanto de ellas. Podría poneros muchos links que lleven a páginas que lo expliquen y que os den información muy interesante, pero prefiero hacer mi propia charla de esto.

- **Primera parte: ""Onda"".** Una onda es una perturbación que se propaga por el espacio a una velocidad finita. ¿Qué es una perturbación? Un cambio en las propiedades de un objeto o un campo. Con entender ésto medianamente me vale, hay muchas cosas que se podrían decir sobre las ondas.

- **Segunda parte: ""Gravitacional"".** Medianamente entendible en lenguaje coloquial, muy complicado de entender en lenguaje físico. Entra aquí en juego la Relatividad General, y movidas para las cuales habría que estudiar unos años.

Desde los tiempos de la Relatividad Especial, *Einstein* postuló la existencia de ondas gravitatorias, al tiempo que afirmaba que como nada podía viajar más rápido que la luz, tampoco podía hacerlo la gravedad, es decir, la acción que la gravedad ejerce sobre un cuerpo. Así, si el Sol desapareciera de repente, nuestra Tierra seguiría en órbita en torno a un punto imaginario durante aproximadamente 8 minutos el tiempo que tarda la luz en viajar del Sol a la Tierra. También , si se creara un Sol instantáneamente en algún punto del sistema Solar , nuestro planeta sufriría una nueva órbita pasado un cierto tiempo. Se puede entender entonces el concepto de ""Onda gravitatoria"" ahora, con lo que hemos dicho anteriormente.

Algo más sutil encontramos cuando nos metemos en las tripas de la Relatividad General. En ella, las masas medianamente grandes, para efectos apreciables, deforman la estructura del espacio y el flujo del tiempo, de forma que las masas se atraen por efectos geométricos de este mismo espacio-tiempo, y no porque en sí haya una fuerza que medie entre ambas. La luz no sigue tampoco entonces una línea recta o deflexión de la luz, sino que ahora se cambia el concepto a seguir **líneas geodésicas**, dando a entender que no siempre lo recto es recto, al menos en presencia de masas considerables.

Pues bien, como el todo es más que la suma de las partes, vamos a juntarlo todo. `Onda gravitatoria` es una perturbación de un objeto en los casos que podemos hallar,agujeros negros súper-masivos binarios , que consiste en una deformación del espacio-tiempo como consecuencia de una interacción, y que ésta se propaga a través del espacio y puede llegar o no, a nosotros. ¿Cómo sabemos que hemos visto una onda gravitatoria? Con experimentos de detección, cómo no. Uno de los más famosos es el experimento `LIGO (Laser Inteferometer Gravitational Observatory)`, usando láseres de alta precisión y un interferómetro , para medir la diferencia de longitudes entre dos brazos metálicos colocados en dos posiciones perpendiculares, haciendo así que un brazo se alargue o achique más que otro al detectar la presencia de una onda gravitatoria en su dirección. Os dejaré un artículo para que podáis informaros mejor del experimento.

Éste demuestra la existencia de ondas gravitatorias que fueron postuladas un siglo atrás , por Albert Einstein. Esto nos da nuevos ojos para ver el Universo. ¿Porqué?. Porque hasta ahora sólo hemos tenido un sólo medio de información para ver el Universo : la luz (ondas electromagnéticas). Luz con sus diferentes intensidades y diferentes fuentes (se puede identificar los elementos químicos que crean luz a partir de su espectrografía), con sus modelos de comportamiento... En definitiva, se han llenado tomos y tomos sobre el Universo, mucha gente trabaja y se quiere dedicar (yo entre otros) a ésto, y nuestra única herramienta es la luz eso sí, estudiada al extremo. Quién sabe lo que se podría encontrar allí afuera con una nueva fuente de conocimiento, como son las ondas gravitatorias, aunque eso sí, de detección más dificultosa. Pero ahí están, y una nueva etapa de la ciencia está por descubrirse.

2016-12-14-mi-experiencia.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'REFLEXIONES: Mi experiencia', 'show_title': True, 'mathjax': True, 'tags': ['Physics']}","Hola gente. Bueno vengo a contaros un poco mi experiencia y parte de mi vida personal . Así, para desahogarme , y que me vayáis conociendo o identificándoos conmigo espero. Antes de nada decir que este post va a ser largo y para muchos aburrido, pero si os gusta mi contenido quizá os interese de más leerlo, porque aquí resumo toda mi experiencia de mis años de carrera en la UCM y todo lo que soy yo. Espero lo disfrute quien pueda.

Nací en Córdoba, España, he vivido toda mi vida allí , aunque mi familia siempre fue de hacer muchos viajes a distintos lugares de Europa y de África. He tenido suerte en ese aspecto, siempre me enseñaron a valorar y aprender de otras culturas. Mis padres podían permitírselo y lo hacían, sin más.

He pasado gran parte de mi vida jugando ajedrez, que es mi juego favorito. En parte, ahora pienso que fue gracias a personas carismáticas que supieron transmitirme su energía y apoyo y sin las cuales nunca habría llegado lejos, y en parte a esos padres que apoyaron a ciegas a su hijo. Llegué a ser bueno a mi edad , uno de los mejores de España. Pero el tiempo pasa y tiene poder sobre todos nosotros.

Siempre fuí alguien de buenos y contados amigos, que no frikis, a quien se le dió bien las matemáticas y pensar sobre muchas cosas extravagantes. Hoy en día eso es relativamente normal. Leía, me informaba y me llamaba la atención la ciencia. Descubrí que mi carrera serían ciencias puras y estaba muy ilusionado con esto.

Llegué a la universidad , con ánimos para empezar mi nueva carrera de Física , en Madrid. Parecía que tenía muy claro qué quería ser: Astrofísico. ""Como muchos"" me decían. El primer año me dijeron que para llegar lejos habría que tomárselo muy en serio todo, sobre todo en las notas. En mi colegio mayor pasé bastante tiempo con amigos que les gustaba salir y pasarlo bien como todo el mundo. Recuerdo no estudiar más de 1 o 2 horas al día y fue en parte mi confianza y mi error. Mis notas no fueron de escándalo pero si aceptables Notables. Supongo que llevaba buena base de Bachiller, a otros les costó bastante más. Los profesores eran simpáticos pero pasaban un poco de nosotros, en mi opinión, no se tomaban en serio las notas de cada uno ni los problemas de clase, ni se preparaban las clases, lo cual hacían de los apuntes un caos. Sin más.

Llegué a 2º de carrera. ¡Vaya año! No he estudiado más y pasado peor en mi vida. Llegué a desesperarme y a querer irme de Madrid, cambiar de carrera y de vida. El colegio mayor ya no me gustaba, ya estaba bastante estresado en mi día a día como para permitirme fallar y dejarme caer en la vagueza con algunos. Si hubiese aprovechado al 100% mi tiempo, cosa que nunca supe hacer, hubiese sobrellevado la situación, pero al límite. Este año dimos toda la física clásica: Mecánica, Electromagnetismo, Métodos Matemáticos, Física Cuántica.., con Laboratorio siendo la asignatura más frustrante: todas las semanas más de 8 horas en laboratorio,más las horas de preparación y presentación de informes. Este año no saqué en general buenas notas y suspendí algunas asignaturas. Y los profesores, malos, por lo general.

En 3º me cambié a piso con un amigo de la facultad. Todo parecía ir mejor y más tranquilo, podía hacer lo que quisiese cuando quisiese y no tener que depender de otros. Fue un año mucho más relajado que el anterior, aunque las asignaturas fueron complicándose, obviamente. Arrastraba un par de asignaturas de 2º , que fuí con paciencia sacándolas. Ya no había tanta gente que conocía. Algo extraño pasó en 2º de carrera , algunos se fueron, otros se quedaron, otros avanzaron y otros estaban rezagados. No pondré en juicio nada porque no me parece correcto, sigamos. Había asignaturas que ya sí, hay que decirlo: molaban más. Geometría diferencial y Astrofísica... !Por fin! Parece que ya hemos llegado adonde queremos , aun así los profesores parecen más majos que los de 2º , pero guardan la misma actitud pasota. Empiezan a notarse favoritismos con ciertos alumnos, peloteos prolongados y charlas de despacho. Bueno, nada raro que no hubiese ya en 2º , aunque los profesores saben cuando y porqué... Ya llevan años a sus espaldas. Y por fin, este año se acabaron las pesadas asignaturas de Laboratorio. ""Se acabó el estrés"" pensé.

En 4º me dije: voy a coger asignaturas de más, entre ellas, algunas que me sirvan de para aprobar ""fácil"" y otras para estudiar de verdad y aprender. Ninguna otra opción era la mía , no quería jugármela a un todo o nada. Después de todo, demasiados horrores habían pasado ya como para hacerlo. Escogí ""Tutorías"", que después de todo no estuvo nada mal, e ""Historia de la Física"" como asignaturas que bueno... ahí están. En mis asignaturas optativas para estudiar escogí ""Partículas elementales"" con uno de los profesores más temidos de la facultad, y ""Relatividad General"" dos huesos bastante duros que bueno... algunos se tiraron vidas estudiando. Resulta que había dos asignaturas que eran ""optativas"", pero ""obligatorias de itinerario"" , lo cual me estresaba un poco: ""Electrodinámica Clásica"" y ""Física Atómíca y Molecular"". Física Atómica parecía fácil y nos la dió uno de los mejores profesores en mi opinión, pero adivinad qué, a mitad de curso , nos metieron 8 prácticas de laboratorio sorpresa, para que no nos aburriésemos antes de los exámenes. La cosa fue peor en Electrodinámica para mí, un profesor que decían era bueno, pero demasiado exigente , el cual me cogí. Suspendí en febrero y junio. Con todo lo demás aprobado, incluido el TFG el cual hay que decir que también pasaron bastante de nosotros, me hicieron repetir curso por una sola asignatura, teniendo en cuenta que poseía en ese momento 240 créditos, pero que al no tener la ""obligatoria de itinerario"" aprobada, no podía obtener la carrera porque era obligatorio ""1 itinerario"", y por lo cual me hicieron pagar otra vez el TFG aun teniéndolo aprobado para el año siguiente. Conclusión: sólo tengo 232 créditos , más un lío tremendo con la administración porque nunca lo ponen bien en el campus virtual.

En ese 5º año me encuentro. Un año de preocupación y desasosiego, un año que pensé que no se produciría y que en tal caso habría un mecanismo para evitarlo y pasar con 240 créditos. Craso error de mi parte. Sobretodo aprendí de la experiencia: Nadie te regalará nada, y en caso que lo haga, será una sorpresa y deberás agradecerle muchísimo. Habrá amigos que estén ahí en los momentos que les interese, pero desaparecerán en los momentos que más los necesites. Habrá gente que sabe muy bien lo que quiere y no los entenderás hasta que pase lo que tenga que pasar. Tu también fallarás queriendo o no, pero no te dirán nada. Quizá algunos te juzguen por tu región de origen, otros directamente se crean superiores y otros simplemente sean gente abierta y normal. Habrá frikis, muchos, y gente fría. Habrá ""filósofos"" , como yo, que estén en varios proyectos e incluso creando un blog como éste.

Pero sobretodo, habrá gente activa, gente que no se queda parada y que está suficientemente preparada y abierta , que es lo que hoy en día se necesita en el mundo. Por ello, doy gracias a todos los profesores, buenos y malos que hallamos encontrado, porque han formado parte de lo que somos hoy en día los científicos. Y os recomiendo mucho esta carrera , si sois de ese tipo de personas que se ha identificado conmigo y quiere llegar a ser algo útil en la vida y no simplemente un recurso humano de una empresa quealgunosloseremos,peroconunfondodetrás. Desde mi punto de vista ninguna otra carrera aparte de química y matemáticas es científica. Y ya pueden ponerse como quieran. La ciencia es método científico, y no sirve a ninguna empresa o interés particular. Se nutre por sí misma y quiere verse crecer, aumentar. No es para nada inservible ni inútil sin algún propósito que ofrecer, al contrario, es conocimiento humano y debe ser respetado y sufragado lo suficiente como para crear una humanidad digna y evolucionada.

2016-12-14-existe-Dios.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'REFLEXIONES: ¿Existe Dios para un científico?', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['Physics']}","Hoy trataremos un tema que siempre nos hemos preguntado todos. Yo, recordando que soy un científico con cierto optimismo, al menos en la evolución , quizá piense que la ciencia pueda dar respuesta ahora o en un futuro a esta pregunta : ¿Existe algo más allá de nosotros mismos , algo con poder sobrenatural, que haya creado o dirija nuestras vidas y el cosmos completo?. Más bien la pregunta sería : ¿Qué funciones tendría algo de este estilo, de ser que exista, y cuál es su relación con nosotros? Más aún, la pregunta que no me gustaría que hiciéseis sería: ¿Para qué me va a servir saber que existe o incluso pensar en Dios?. Pero conmigo, por favor no piensen en ""Para qué me sirve"".

Pero sobretodo la pregunta que relaciona mi profesión sería: ¿Nos puede ayudar la ciencia a saber si Dios existe o no?. Para ello haré una distinción clara entre filosofía y religión , al menos en hechos cronológicos desde lo que sucedió en la antiguedad. Los primeros filósofos griegos, como Tales de Mileto, ya echaban por tierra los fenómenos a los que la gente solía identificar con Dioses, no me pararé a explicar más ésto. Por ende, la filosofía desde sus orígenes ha estado enfrentada con la religión. En una época de control social como la de Tomás de Aquino, muchos clérigos intentaron someter la filosofía a la religión con ideas que a mi parecer introducen falacias o falsedades que son aceptables culturalmente, pero que dejan mucho que desear para un examen exhaustivo.

No daré inmediatamente el paso de filosofía a ciencia, porque principalmente, no lo tiene. Para mí son cosas distintas, aunque en sus inicios se complementaron muy bien. La filosofía aún sigue participando y aceptando ideas que son culturalmente aceptables, como la idea del bien o el mal universal, la verdad, y la subjetividad de cada uno de los invididuos, pero que como digo, un examen exhaustivo podría poner en duda muchos de estos conceptos. Parece que la filosofía es un terreno tremendamente subjetivo. Y es cierto que desde la subjetividad se pueden contemplar muchos puntos de vista e incluso apreciarlos, pero es un tipo de aprecio como el que un padre tiene a su hijo: soy el adulto y pienso mejor que tú, por tanto mi opinión será más válida. Aceptémoslo, la subjetividad siempre será así. Muchos científicos piensan que la filosofía es complementaria de la ciencia e incluso se necesitan mutuamente. Yo discrepo. Principalmente porque no piensan igual, las reglas del ""juego"" no son las mismas para ambas disciplinas. Las ideas de verdad y belleza no son necesarias para la ciencia, e incluso podrían llegar a contaminar la actividad científica. Alguien que haya leído biografías de científicos sabrán de lo que hablo. Pero no podemos despegarnos nunca de la subjetividad que nos hace humanos.

Y ahora me diréis que llegaré a la conclusión de que la ciencia es la verdad objetiva y absoluta, que ansío llegar con este razonamiento ahí. Pues no. La ciencia se pregunta sobre sí misma y debe ser crítica en todo momento. Las personas somos subjetivas, incluso los científicos. Dentro de nosotros, sabemos que queremos llegar a algo bonito, un bonito final. Incluso yo tengo la idea de que quiero trabajar para encontrar algo bello y ordenado, no un universo lleno de caos e impredecibilidad. Incluso dentro del caos debemos buscar orden y comprensión. Muchos grandes científicos también trabajaron con esta idea en la cabeza :vamos a crear lo más simple dentro de nuestras teorías que nos permita comprender todos los fenómenos del mundo natural. Otro día os hablaré de Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen, también os recomiendo veáis la película `Matrix` para empezar a darle vueltas al tema. La ciencia intenta ser la verdad, pero algo lo suficientemente simple como para entender la naturaleza sin recurrir a ese misticismo sin sentido del pasado. ¿ Qué hay de verdad en todo esto?

Estrictamente hablando , no existe conexión entre la idea de Dios y el mundo científico, al menos como lo pienso yo. ¿Porqué? Porque no sabemos qué es Dios. ¿Es el dios musulmán, el cristiano , o el de alguna tribu indígena? ¿Hay uno sólo? ¿Qué papel desempeña? ¿Fiarse de supuestos espíritus que nos hablan o de nuestra idea de belleza y simpleza es suficiente prueba para el método científico como para llegar a una conclusión? En mi opinión no, y nunca lo será. Porque tenemos que partir de algo que entendamos con nuestros sentidos y nuestra experiencia cotidiana, para indagar más sobre el asunto, incluso de forma matemática. Por ello creo que la única opinión coherente que puede tener la ciencia al respecto es el agnosticismo, tan válido como el que posee Stephen Hawking , entre otros.

Lo que sí es cierto es que podemos obtener cientos de hechos objetivos, o ""pistas subjetivas"" para afirmar o negar la existencia de Dios. El hecho de que haya unas leyes en el universo y no otras, por ejemplo, permite nuestra delicada existencia. El tamaño y la carga de un electrón, las partículas que lo componen, sus interacciones, sus ratios, sus spines... la ""fuerza"" de la gravedad junto con otras e incluso la relatividad especial y general, la historia aparentemente caótica que siguió nuestro universo y en el cual predominó la materia sobre la antimateria...y algunas otras historias de un joven científico. Todo ello conjuntamente permite nuestra delicada existencia. Pregunta: ¿somos el resultado aleatorio de todo este conjunto de cosas que permiten nuestra delicada existencia , o algo ha creado este universo para que se mantenga estable siguiendo un orden cósmico y nosotros somos, al igual que todas las cosas , parte de ese plan? Respuesta: ¿qué vino antes, el huevo o la gallina? Imposible saberlo. Creo que sí que podríamos encontrar alguna civilización extraterrestre o incluso algún mecanismo de otra dimensión que influya en nuestras vidas e incluso nos dirija. ¿Pero llamaremos ""Dios"" a eso? ¿O algo se esconderá incluso detrás de ellos? El tiempo dirá que nos depara ese saber. Una cosa es clara, las preguntas no hacen más que comenzar.

Espero que esta sea la primera de muchas entradas que dedico a la ciencia y a la divulgación de la misma, sobre todo espero que sea algo más enfocado a la vida y evolución personal de un científico , que en mi caso, soy yo.

Mi objetivo es acercar la ciencia a la gente, poniendo de manifiesto la belleza de la misma y su inquietud sobre temas existenciales que comparten otras ramas tan importantes como la misma religión o filosofía. Hablaremos de ellas , pero también hablaremos de temas más técnicos tratados con lenguaje científico y de noticias relacionadas con el mundo científico. Pero la idea principal es que todo el mundo sea capaz de entender cada una de las entradas de este blog y sea capaz de profundizar si así desea en el conocimiento de áreas tan importantes como la Astrofísica , Física Teórica  o Física de Altas Energías.

Si estás pensando en ser científico o siempre te ha interesado el tema, esta página te resultará muy interesante y esclarecedora, así como mis post sobre ciencia, entrevistas... etc, que iré enlazando para que todos vosotros disfrutéis si os gusta pensar sobre el mundo y sobre cosas más allá de nuestra vida cotidiana.

2011-06-22-move-election.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'Elección de la jugada', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['Chess']}","Ahora hablaré un poco sobre la elección de la jugada, con temas como las jugadas candidatas, momentos críticos, jugadas "" en cartera"",jugadas multiusos y profilaxis.

Este es un tema bastante amplio por lo que no nos pararemos en profundidad a detallar todos estos conceptos, sólo a explicar en qué casos son útiles y cómo podemos estar seguros de una elección de jugada.

Empezaré hablando sobre el árbol de variantes. Muchos programas de análisis y entrenadores usan un árbol de variantes, en los que van eligiendo sus jugadas y hacen análisis para determinar que posición es la que más interesa. Esto a práctica humana resulta bastante difícil de dominar, pues debemos tener memoria para memorizar todas las posiciones resultantes y jugadas, procedimiento y objetividad. Algo que puede ayudar mucho es el haber visto partidas antes con posiciones similares, porque sabemos los planes que hay que hacer y lo tenemos más claro.

 Aún con todo, siempre pueden sorprendernos con una jugada diferente y tendremos que volver a empezar, o haber deseado escoger otra continuación. Aconsejo también seguir las variantes forzadas, es decir, si ves que una continuación para conseguir ventaja es más forzada que otra, guíate por esta continuación, porque vas a evitarte disgustos.

Por último, están las jugadas como las profilácticas, jugadas en cartera, amenazas , y las multiusos. Es importante manejar siempre este tipo de jugadas, en algunas posiciones es posible que te quedes sin gasolina, es decir, sin un plan claro que hacer, en cuyo caso tienes que ver que haciendo jugadas normales vas a llegar a igualdad o a algo poco claro que no te gusta.  En ese caso hay que considerar :

1 Jugadas profilácticas: Son aquellas que evitan los planes del contrario, es decir, si no tienes nada mejor que hacer, por lo menos haz que tu contrario lo pase mal. Un ejemplo de este tipo de jugadas es h3, aparentemente inofensiva, pero defiende una clavada con Ag4, y prepara el rey para una salida por h2 en un futuro. Esto te puede dar un tiempo extra a lo largo de la partida.

2. Jugadas multiusos. Son aquellas jugadas que no se concentran sólo en una función. Puedes tener varios planes con esa misma jugada, lo cual es más difícil de detectar y/o parar. Un ejemplo de esto es el típico pase de torre a 3ª , con lo que el rival no sabe si pretendes doblar torres, o pasar la torre a la columna g o h para atacar. Simplemente mejorar la posición de las piezas o de los reyes también entra en este tipo de jugadas.

3. Jugadas en cartera. Son aquellas jugadas que siempre tienes, como un cambio de peones, una jugada sencilla para defender la posición o una amenaza latente. Quizá en un momento determinado no te sirvan pero sirven para evitar planes del contrario y darte la iniciativa más tarde

Con este tipo de conceptos creo que nos vamos acercando en un sentido más amplio y profundo a cómo piensa un jugador profesional, un GM, quizá todas estas cosas no sse digan pero están ahí y las sentimos, el ajedrez es más amplio de lo que se piensa."
2011-06-22-Chessbase.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'Chessbase', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['Chess']}","El Chessbase es un programa para almacenar partidas en bases de datos. Esto es bastante resumido claro, los nuevos programas de Chessbasse, como el Chessbase 11, incluyen multitud de funciones, como módulos de análisis, analizar por tiempo indefinido, clasificar partidas por temas , finales, táctica, etc. También se pueden incluir comentarios, exportar a otros programas y correos, fusionar bases, hacer dossiers, ver información de los jugadores, clasificar sus aperturas y mucho más. Todo esto y más ha sido lo que ha convertido a este programa en el programa estrella del ajedrez a nivel mundiaen cuanto a preparación se refiere, tanto es así que se venden versiones gratuitas o LIGHT de este programa, en las cuales se suele inclluir una pequeña base de datos como modelo.

Lo que la gente normalmente hace en el Chessbase es meter sus apuntes y análisis, analizar y prepararse contra cualquier rival, al tener una base de datos de mas de 30 millones de partidas en la cual entcontrar a un rival de mas de 2000 de Elo es bastante probable. Paso a comentar sin más las ventajas e inconvenientes del programa, también mi opinión sobre la funcionalidad del programa y sus partes fundamentales.

### Ventajas:

- Se dispone de una Big Database o Mega Database con varios millones de partidas
- Se encuentran fácilmente las partidas de titulados en todo el mundo,  y es especialmente útil en el caso de los grandes campeones de la historia.
- Se pueden crear tus propios apuntes, análisis,teoría, meter tus partidas a una propia base de datos, comentarlas, analizarlas,imprimirlas y exportarlas.
- Se puede buscar por jugadores y torneos y pedir dossiers, e información sobre el jugador, como su edad, mayor elo, nacionalidad, así como ver sus partidas, aperturas, fusionar sus partidas y ver el repertorio que tiene, muy útil para prepararse
- Las opciones de tablero y demás en el programa son muy variadas, da una gran versatibilidad y dinámica.
- Es fácil buscar distintos tipos de partida o una partida en concreto a través del filtro


### Inconvenientes:

- La mayoría de veces , nos hacemos un lío intentando ordenar las partidas, eliminar duplicadas, y fusionar partidas.
- Sólo incluye la Big Database y la Mega Database en algunos. Después de ahí cada uno se busca sus propias bases de datos, muchas personas las compran de internet, esto tiene la ventaja de que las partidas te vienen comentadas y ya están pasadas al ordenador, lo cual ahorra bastante trabajo.


Y pasando a la conclusión, el Chessbase es un programa que todo jugador que se precie debería tener en su ordenador. Sus ventajas son esencialmente muy grandes en comparación con sus inconvenientes, que parecen mas bien chistosos en comparación con otros programas. Es un programa muy completo, del que cada vez sacan nuevas versiones con más  aplicaciones y funciones."
2011-06-21-Portales-Internet-ICC.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'Portales de Internet (ICC)', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['Chess']}","Ahora hablaré sobre el portal Internet Chess Club, o más abreviadamente, ICC. Se trata sobre un portal de uso privado al que se accede pagando en distintas cuotas, como un año , por meses o por varios años. Hay una oferta especial de estudiantes y alguna vez la fada hizo un trato especial con ellos para reducir el precio.
Pasamos sin más a las ventajas e inconvenientes.

## **Internet Chess Club (ICC):**

### Ventajas:
- Es internacional
- Se encuentra un mayor número de titulados y en general, un nivel más alto
- Se imparten clases gratis o pagadas en eventos
- Se retransmiten los torneos de mayor relevancia a nivel mundial con jugadores de la talla de Carlsen , Kramnik, Karjakin, Nakamura, Radjabov, Ivanchuk y muchos más.
- Se pueden ver las partidas rápidas que juegan distintos titulados como GM's en tiempo real.
- La interfaz de la gráfica de retos es mejor que en otros portales y tiene mayores opciones de reto.
- Se puede cambiar la visualización de los tableros en la pantalla de juego y tiene muchas más opciones que otros portales. Te dejan crear tu propio tablero y ver información acerca de otras personas con los comandos de la consola principal.
- Posee varias salas de chat organizadas por temas y en los que no hay intrusos.
- Ofrece simultáneas de titulados y bastantes torneos.

### Inconvenientes:
- Es un portal de uso privado, por tanto, de pago.
- Es menos conocido a nivel de aficionados, por lo tanto no es muy útil al intentar jugar con cualquier amigo por este portal porque es muy probable que no lo tenga.
- Para mí resulta un pequeño estorbo los mensajes de bienvenida y demás , aunque se pueden desactivar en el menú opciones.
- La mayoría de audios y demás están en inglés, y por tanto, también éste es el idioma predominante en los chats y conversaciones con los rivales.
- Muchas de las órdenes hay que ejecutarlas por comandos que hay que escribir en la consola principal."
2011-06-17-time-control.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'Administración del tiempo', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['Chess']}","Muchos jugadores tenemos un problema con el tiempo. Entre ellos, yo mismo. El tiempo es uno de los factores que más influye en una partida de ajedrez, tanto en rápidas como en lentas, más de una vez se nos ha dado un fallo por un apuro de tiempo, o nos hemos dejado alguna pieza, son cosas que pasan, en este post daréconsejos sobre el uso del tiempo y su racionación en las jugadas.

1. Anotar en la planilla los momentos claves de la partida y de ser posible, todos o casi todos los tiempos que habéis gastado en las jugadas, luego se puede ver la relación tiempo-calidad de la jugada en los análisis posteriores y trabajar en esa área.
2. Como norma general, se debe gastar entre 30 y 40 minutos en la apertura, si estamos hablando de partidas largas de 1:30 horas mas medio minuto de incremento por jugada.
3. Es importante considerar los momentos críticos de las partidas. Estos son en los que debemos tomar una decisión importante, como un plan, un cambio de piezas, táctica o una operación estratégica. En estos momentos no debemos de tener miedo en tomarnos más tiempo del necesario, considerando todas las jugadas candidatas y análisis. Esto lo detallaré en la eleccion de la jugada.
4. En un apuro de tiempo, es importante también saber cuándo es un momento importante y tener la sangre fría de parar un momento y pensar, del mismo modo, no debemos gastar más tiempo del necesario en jugadas evidentes como recapturas de piezas.
5. Si consideramos dos alternativas como aproximadamente iguales, no debemos gastar más tiempo, y elegiremos la que más nos guste o la que parezca el plan más simple y efectivo. Gastar más tiempo del necesario hace que luego te estrelles en el apuro de tiempo.
6. No levantarse en apuros de tiempo, y generalmente, hacer nuestras necesidades biológicas durante la partida para evitar malestar más tarde.

Bueno, estos son los consejos que se me han ocurrido hasta ahora, si se les ocurren más les agradecería que comentaran el post."

Por supuesto que hay más aperturas y todas ellas merecen ser tomadas en consideración, pero dado que estas tres aperturas son las más jugadas y comunes en torneos y demás, hablaremos sobre estas 3 por motivos prácticos.De estas 3 aperturas se derivan la gran mayoría de esquemas y temas comunes, como el poeón de damaaislado, la estructura maaroczy, la estructura carlsbad, etc.

A continuación iré describiendo en qué consiste cada salida y las consideraciones generales que se tienen sobre ellas y los tipos de jugadores y esquemas que se esconden tras ellas, será un buen comentario crítico sobre ellas, espero que os gust

1 e4
Los jugadores de e4 son , en su gran mayoría, agresivos y tácticos. Se recomiendaen edades tempranas jugar e4, porque se necesita crear una buena base táctica y desarrollar la lógica en el juego abierto. Se denominan aperturas abiertas a todas las aperturas que comienzan por 1 e4 e5. Se denominan aperturas semicerradas a culquier apertura cuya primera jugada blanca sea  1e4 y el negro responda cualquier otra cosa que no sea e5. Por tanto, e4 englobalas aperturas semicerradas y abiertas. En mi opinión es la mejro apertura, por tanto la juego, pero hay que saber bastante teoría, ya que en el juego abierto cualquiier fallo suele ser más peligroso que en el juego cerrado, con la ventaja de que también tu rival puede equivocarse antes y ganar tú, o como se dice, la partida tiene un ritmo rápido. También hay que mencionar que ciertas aperturas como la defensa Petrodf se consideran tablíferas, y que bastantes estructuras de e4 también. Aun así, es mi apertura.

1 d4
Los jugadores de d4 son en su mayoría estratégicos, auqnue eso no quiere decir que les falte la táctica. Dentro de esta jugada hay mucha variabilidad de esquemas , algunos más tácticos y activos que otros, , otros más cerrados, y tablíferos.Suele ser importante la elección de un plan de juego, aunque siempre lo es, especialmente en las possiciones de peon de dama."

De siempre se ha dicho que jugar a este tipo de juegos es malo para jugar al ajedrez. Todo lo contrario. Desarrolla bastantes habilidades que el ajedrez necesita y de una forma bastante divertida.Eso sí , como todo, no hay que pasarse. Pasaré a explicar algunos de los juegos que se han ideado y modalidades de ajedrez. Las damas, aunque se juegue en un tablero, no lo considero otra modalidad de juego, porque no hay piezas de ajedrez.

- Pasapiezas:

También llamado Vicio. Consiste en jugar por equipos , con tableros pares de 2. Pueden hacerse con 4, 8  o más tableros incluso, siempre que se alternen blancas-negras. En principio, las piezas que capturas del rival se las pasas a tu compañero y éste puede en su turno como quiera. Hay ciertas reglas que se pueden modificar como que valga entrar con jaque, que valga poner peones en séptima, que valga entrar en mate o que se corone dama o se quite pieza. Es muy diverso y sirve para desarrollar mucho la creatividad y el cálculo. Aunque siempre se ha dicho que jugar a esto en medio de un torneo es malísimo para las partidas porque no vas a poder meter una pieza de fuera dentro del tablero.Es uno de los más conocidos

- Comilón:

O comepiezas.Consiste en dejarse todas las piezas, incluso el rey. Cuando puedas capturar, estás obligado a capturar y se avisa diciendo "" Come"". Quien da mate, pierde.De nuevo se pueden modificar las reglas , como dejarse el rey o no, a jaque tener que mover el rey o poder mover otra pieza, dejarse el rey el último, etc. Desarrolla de nuevo el cálculo y flexibilidad de pensamiento, además tienes que tener en cuenta que  los peones es más difícil perderlos , por lo que no es fácil.

- Periódico:

Las columnas y diagonales continúan al otro lado del tablero. Puedes comer un peón de h con uno de a y viceversa, puedes pasar las piezas de un lado a otro... El mate hay que darlo en la primera o 8 fila.

- Acumulativo:

No sé como se llama en realidad, pero se trata de ir jugando , el primer movimiento con un tiempo, el segundo jugando dos veces, el tercero tres, así sucesivamente. Cuando se da un jaque, se vuelve a empezar con 1-2-3.

Por ahora no se me ocurren más, si ven alguno más o quieren matizar algo, comenten."
2011-06-17-chess-motivations.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'Motivaciones del ajedrez', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['Chess']}","Bien os voy a hablar ahora sobre las motivaciones que el ajedrez presenta para nosotros, los aficionados, y para toda clase de niveles y edades, desde niños a adultos. Cuando hemos sido niños, lo más probable es que empezáramos en este del ajedrez porque nuestro padre nos enseñó, o porque nos lo propuso un amigo y entonces empezaste a jugar y a ganarle y de ahí cogiste el gusto por el juego. En mi caso me inició mi padre y cogí tal gusto, que incluso me enfadé con un amigo por no querer jugar a otras cosas.

Después muchos de nosotros imagino que entramos a un club o escogimos a un monitor para que llevara adelante nuestro progreso e interés por este deporte. Jugamos nuestros primeros torneos, ganamos , perdimos, nos lo pasamos bien, conocimos gente, ( incluso a veces nos enamoramos) , y todo eso hace un efecto feedback o retroalimentador, que satisface nuestra necesidad de jugar, aparte de la propia satisfacción que da haber ganado al ajedrez , un juego de estrategia e inteligencia, propio de la elegancia y estilo de la persona, con lo cual podemos presumir hacia otras personas. Bien empezaré a enumerar nuestras principales motivaciones.

- Los amigos/amigas: Nos gusta hacer amigos y amigas en los torneos y compartir ratos agradables con ellos, de eso no hay duda. ¿Quien puede decir que no se lo pasa bien en un torneo? si no lo hace es porque no quiere, sin duda. Ellos son una de nuestras principales motivaciones, ver gente ( por cierto muy simpática) a la que vemos poco y necesitamos ver, mucha gente tiene esto como una motivación.
- Los entrenadores: Sí, os estaréis preguntando : ¿Qué?. Los entrenadores son a menudo personas magnéticas y carismáticas que nos tienen comiendo de sus manos, hacemos cuanto esté en nuestro poder para agradarles y por estar en su compañía, ya que disfrutamos de ella.
- Nuestra necesidad de mostrar nuestra valía.
- Nuestro amor por la lógica e inteligencia.
- La presión de los padres/tutores.
- La necesidad de relajarse unos días/vacaciones."
2011-06-17-Portales-Internet-Buho21.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'Portales de internet ( Búho 21)', 'tags': ['Chess']}","Empiezo una serie sobre los portales de ajedrez en internet , mi objetivo es informar y expresar mi opinión acerca de cada uno de ellos.También las opiniones diversas que se tienen acerca de ellos. Comenzaré hablando por el quizá más popular Búho 21 entre las clases aficionadas, ya que es una plataforma bastante aceptable y de acceso gratuito. Iré poniendo lo que creo que son las ventajas e inconvenientes de cada portal, se agradecen comentarios.


## Búho 21:

### Ventajas:
- Es gratuita
- Tiene mucha actividad en torneos
- Tiene una forma de premiar a sus usuarios y es concediéndoles medallas por los distintos torneos ganados
- Posee más formas de juego que no son estrictamente ajedrez, por ejemplo, pasapiezas, comilón, ajedrez atómico, etc, lo que lo hace mucho más popular y dinámico al ser uno de los pocos portales de ajedrez que hacen esto.
- Posee una interfaz gráfica bastante intuitiva y un chat bastante animado
- Se pueden agregar y desagregar amigos y buscarlos para hablar con ellos.

### Desventajas:
- No posee eventos a retransmitir en la cuenta norma
- No se dan clases ni otras muchas funciones que poseen otros portales, al ser gratuito esto no se financia.
- En el chat siempre hay el típico que mete cizaña y es banneado
- La pantalla del tablero no es de mi gusto y hay poca variabilidad para cambiarla
- Si no eres usuario VIP , te pierdes las clases con maestros, los eventos, las simultáneas, las partidas que se retrasnmiten y mucho más."
2011-06-14-presentation.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'Presentación', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['Chess']}","Bueno, voy a empezar mi primer post comentando un poco mi nivel ahora que empiezo el blog y acreditándome. Primero voy a acreditarme.

Mi nombre es *Álvaro Riobóo*, jugador español, de la provincia de *Córdoba* y federado por la *FADA*. Tengo 16 años, cumplo el 26/07 y nací en 1994. Actualmente:

- Elo FADA: 2230
- Elo FEDA (Federacion Española de Ajedrez): 2204
- Elo FIDE( Federación Internacional de Ajedrez): 2202

Debo comentar que ha habido fluctuaciones importantes del elo, así como en un momento llegué a tener 2270 Fada, bajó 50 o 60 puntos y luego recuperé. En pags como:

http://www.elo-ajedrez.com/
http://ratings.fide.com/

Se puede ver mi elo y progresión Fide, igual con cualquier otro jugador que deseen.

Ahora os comento mi nivel a fecha de este post:

Soy un jugador que no se puede considerar ni demasiado inmaduro ni demasiado curtido en el juego. Un jugador promedio de nivel 2200, trabajé duro hace 1 o 2 años y conseguí llegar hasta este nivel, ahora lo que estoy haciendo es mantenerlo como puedo, si me preguntan como llegué hasta aquí diré que no hay otra forma sino con trabajo y esfuerzo , motivación , y un poco de organización. También es esencial un guía que te lleve por estos caminos, como representa la figura del entrenador, pues si no, uno mismo es difícil que tenga el orden y la certeza para discernir en qué campos debe trabajar y en cuáles no. El valor que aporta un buen entrenador es muy grande. Comentaré esto en otro post más ampliado.

Saludos."
2011-06-14-chess-my-history.md,"{'layout': 'article', 'title': 'Historia personal', 'show_title': True, 'tags': ['Chess']}","Este post puede llegar a ser muy aburrido y largo, quedan avisados, si se les cansa la vista por mi culpa , tienen que acudir a un oculista y/o les causo una depresión por aburrimiento, no me hago responsable ;). De todas formas intentaré ser breve.

Empecé en esto hará unos 9 años. Yo por ese entonces tocaba el piano, mi padre me enseñó un día de buenas a primeras a jugar al ajedrez. Tras unos días de aprender, empecé a jugar partidas con él. La cosa era que yo tocaba media hora el piano y después echábamos una partida de ajedrez. Siempre me ganaba él.

Hasta que un buen día, quizá un buen día en 2 o 3 meses, le gané yo. Empezó a gustarme. A partir de ahí me ganaba algunas y yo otras..., empezó a formarse en mí ese gusto por la competición limpia que todo jugador tiene. Un día mi padre decidió llevarme a mi primer club de Ajedrez , en el centro cívico Sebastián Cuevas, por aquel entonces regido por Francisco Javier Jiménez Crespo, alguien de quien tampoco me olvidaré nunca. Actualmente lo lleva Julián Campos, alumno de Fran, quien retomó el club después de que éste lo dejara.

Al principio era un club lleno de chavales con más edad que yo, recuerdo que todos tenían entre 11 y 17 años , salvo algunos chiquillos que eran bastante más chicos que yo y alguien creo de mi edad. Había un segundo delegado del club llamado Daniel. Fran me empezaba a enseñar cosas mientras yo jugaba con todos los del club. Pasado un mes, tomé la costumbre de echar muchas partidas con Dani, al principio siempre me ganó pero luego fuí remontando. Entonces Fran me propuso federarme para jugar los campeonatos de Andalucía, y lo hice. Me dió entonces 2 grandes libros con temas generales de ajedrez para que me mirara. En el club hacíamos grandes pasapiezas de 8 tableros y alguna vez lo hicimos de 10 y 12, donde uno hacía de transportador de piezas. De vez en cuando yo jugaba algún torneo por cañero. Por aquellos entonces, esto fueron mis orígenes.

Me aprendí bien lo que había en esos libros y seguí progresando. Entraba ese año como sub-12 en los campeonatos de andalucía, que se celebraron en Roquetas de Mar. No quedé muy bien parado pero fui conociendo a gente y ya definitivamente me gustaba.

Cuando tenía 10 años, fuí a un torneo de Córdoba en la Fuensanta donde conocí a otro entrenador, y hasta ahora el que más me ha ayudado: Pedro Manuel Navarro Torres. A él le debo casi todo lo que sé y toda mi progresión ajedrecística en los últimos 5 años y medio. Me dijo que tenía un club y que me pasara, yo lo hice, también había otra panda de chavales, pero ya en un ambiente más serio. Dimos clase en muchos sitios y nos mandaba ejercicios de táctica. Yo siempre que podía se los hacía , otra gente no tanto. Empecé a dejar el club de Fran poco a poco, y éste medio año después no tuvo tiempo para seguir llevando el club y lo cerró. Como yo le hacía ejercicios de táctica y los llevaba al día, por así decirlo era un favorito de la clase.Empezó a darme ya mi primera teoría de apertura, la cual evado de mencionar aquí debido a la privacidad de mi repertorio, aunque supongo que mucha gente lo sabrá.

El año siguiente me clasifiqué como campeón de sub12 en córdoba y fui pagado al campeonato de andalucía, tampoco recuerdo muy bien en qué puesto quedé. Empecé a jugar una serie de torneos importantes en esta etapa de 12 a 14 años,entre ellos los campeonatos de España por edades, de la que no recuerdo demasiado, en la cual me saqué el elo Fide ,Feda y Fada, que en ese entonces no paraba de aumentar.

Con 14 años, recuerdo que me tiré un verano de trabajo intenso para los campeonatos de España. entre ese año y el año siguiente , yo con 15 años, ganamos el provincial de cordoba por equipos ( con mi equipo Postal Cordobés, del club de Pedro), yo gané además el provincial de córdoba de mi edad, después gané el campeonato de andalucía sub 16 y el sub 18 ( con 14 años) y por si fuera poco, gané mi primer c. absoluto de Córdoba. Fué un pedazo de año, y subí el elo como la espuma.

Ya en los años posteriores, me concentré más en los estudios y dejé de estudiar ajedrez, se tradució en resultados , aunque no malos, tampoco nada espectaculares como los anteriores. bajé el elo 50 puntos de un plumazo en un campeonato de España del cual me retiré por mi mal juego. Aunque no estoy orgulloso de retirarme del torneo, se puede decir que en ese momento  yo me entendía. Gané 2 veces más el campeonato absoluto de Córdoba, aún con la participación de un MI. Y llegamos a la actualidad.

Hay muchas cosas que he omitido porque no las considero necesarias o relevantes al caso, sólo mostrar cómo empecé, qué es lo que me hizo seguir y cómo llegué hasta mi nivel, por el único caminso posible, por el de el trabajo y la dedicación."
